Forty years ago, in 1973, UCSC graduated nearly 50 students with this major, all of them from College Five (aka Porter). We are the original, experimental, interdisciplinary, trailblazing, before Slug was Slug arts champions and practitioners. How did we do it?&amp;#160;Come listen to former classmates tell their story of completing the requirements for this major. Hear how it was designed, how it evolved, and where it is now. Santa Cruz County Poet Laureate David Swanger will read a few poems, accompanied by Ivan Rosenblum, both original founding faculty and advisors in the major. Even Pavel Machotka, former provost of College Five and co-creator of the major, will chime in from as far away as Umbria, where he now lives and paints. Also, Nikki Silva, of NPR Kitchen Sisters fame, graduated with this distinguished major and will be here to record our stories.On a campus under construction in the 1960s, we created wood scrap sculptures from debris in our core course, and dorm rooms became print studios and darkrooms. Students led seminars and guilds, created the first arts fair, and enjoyed random exhibitions of drawings (not to forget Etch A Sketch) in the bridge gallery. We are the originals. Even if you did not major in aesthetic studies, or wish you had, you are welcome to join us for what will truly be a first.Coffee, tea, and bagels will be provided.For more information or if you cannot come and would like to send in your story, contact: Ziggy Rendler-BregmanRegister now!

The modern powwow was brought by American Indians to cities such as Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Minneapolis &amp;amp; St. Paul, Tulsa, Austin, and many others as a way to connect to one another culturally, socially, and spiritually.With a population of just 1 percent of the total population of the United States, American Indians are often culturally isolated and experience ongoing colonial trauma as they move away from home, family, and community; powwows are a chance to be around other American Indians, share cultures, songs, dances, and regalia in someplace very far away from what they have known.University powwows also serve as an organizing principle for American Indian student organizations: to connect with family and friends back home, as well as make new connections with other American Indian people. Cultural isolation is often cited as a reason American Indian students drop out of school and return home. Providing a cultural touchstone such as a powwow brings students together and provides a sense of home, of family and community, and a chance to be around other American Indian students to share and connect with in ways that not many non American Indian people understand. The planning is extensive and requires academic, social, planning, and budgetary skills&amp;#8212;all capabilities needed by students to prepare for a rigorous job market that is constantly changing.&amp;#160;About Sophia Garcia-RoblesSophia touched many lives during her 27-year career at UC Santa Cruz. She served as financial aid adviser, mentor, and advocate for many UCSC students. Prior to joining the Financial Aid and Scholarship Office staff, she was employed at Stevenson College. She also volunteered for well over 10 years as a residential preceptor at Merrill College and College Eight.&amp;#160;A natural leader, Soph&amp;#237;a was charismatic, powerful, genuine, and enormously generous.&amp;#160;She dedicated her life to the education and well-being of others and to fighting hunger and poverty. At UC Santa Cruz, Soph&amp;#237;a was responsible for training staff in the Financial Aid and Scholarship Office as well as for serving as an adviser for students.&amp;#160;She was involved in the Chicano/Latino and American Indian communities, she served as a tireless advocate for AB 540 students, and she was a generous contributor to the UC Santa Cruz Food Pantry and to the Educational Opportunity Program Lending Library.The American Indian Resource Center honors Sophia&#39;s life and her commitment to higher education and social justice by naming this annual event for her, an event that seeks to do what she did in her life: make a difference for people in need.

He earned his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago and is interested in early modern Japan, modern Japan, the history of social sciences, colonialism, and nationalism. He is fluent in Japanese.&amp;#160;Teach-In with G. William DomhoffWhat&#39;s New In the World of Dreams Porter College, Hitchcock LoungeFor those who took G. William Domhoff&#39;s course on dreams in the &#39;60s, &#39;70s, or &#39;80s and learned all about the meaning of dreams, or heard about the content of the course second-hand from roommates and friends, there&#39;s much new about the gradual development of dreaming from childhood to young adulthood, and about the parts of the brain that have to be active for dreaming to occur.There&#39;s even new information for those who took the course in the &#39;90s or early 2000s, because there is now strong evidence that the neural substrate that supports dreaming is a subsystem of the regions of the brain that are active when our minds are wandering, or daydreaming, during waking. And there&#39;s now evidence that the social networks found in the content of our dreams follow the same rules as in waking social networks. But there&#39;s still no evidence as to what function, if any, dreams may serve, and there are many elements in dreams that still aren&#39;t understood at all.There will be a quiz at the end, so take careful notes. Just kidding!Teach-In with David DeamerFirst life and next life: An engineer&#39;s approach to understanding living systems Porter College, Room 241David Deamer is a research professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz. Deamer received his undergraduate degree in chemistry from Duke University in 1961, and Ph.D. in physiological chemistry at the Ohio State University School of Medicine, 1965. Over his scientific career, Deamer has maintained a central focus on biological and synthetic membranes. In a second research area, Deamer investigates how the first living cells could have produced the membrane compartments they needed. Deamer was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1986 to work with Murchison meteorite samples at the Australian National University, Canberra, where he extended this research. He is currently using nanopore biosensors to detect nucleic acid polymers synthesized in a robotic device that simulates prebiotic conditions.Teach-In with Harry NollerExploring the ribosome: The ancient molecular machine that translates the genetic code into proteins for all living things Porter College, Room 148Harry Noller is the Sinsheimer Professor of Molecular Biology at UC Santa Cruz. He has received numerous awards and honors for his work, and his laboratory continues to make important advances in understanding how ribosomes work.

We launch ideas, dreams, passions, big thoughts, lives, and careers. The campus itself was launched from the minds of original thinkers &amp;#8212; the rebels and visionaries, artists, scientists, and poets who risked walking off the path to try something different.The idea was to incubate great learning and thinking among small colleges where students lived and learned, while also nestling within a major research university &amp;#8212; all in a spectacular setting that inspired reflection, expansive thinking, and a deep concern about the Earth and its creatures.This provided an unparalleled student experience &amp;#8212; a respite from anonymity, a chance to interact directly with professors and perform real research, and an opportunity to form close bonds with the bright and curious souls living in close proximity.And the experiment has worked. This evening is a celebration of that bounty of intellectual stimulation &amp;#8212; an experience that is launching our current curious and creative students into bright futures.Join us for a strolling dinner where you will have the opportunity to interact with current students and learn about their projects and their future trajectories. After dinner, join us for America in the 21st century &amp;#8211; is America in renaissance or decline?,&amp;#160;a talk by Leon Panetta, chairman of the Panetta Institute for Public Policy and former Secretary of Defense. Continue the conversation and celebration over a delectable assortment of desserts and coffee.For more information, please contact the UC Santa Cruz Special Events Office.

This event happens rain or shine (tours of the telescopes will be substituted if the weather is not conducive to viewing). Click here for a map and directions to Mt. Hamilton. Travel time is about two hours from UC Santa Cruz. Parking will be available at the summit, which is at the top of a long, winding road. Please wear warm clothes, as weather is often cool at the summit.Lick Observatory has a long, distinguished history and has been part of the University of California Observatories system since 1888. In the 1960&amp;#8217;s, most of the astronomy faculty at the observatory moved to the new UCSC campus. The astronomers and technical staff at UCSC and those at Lick Observatory on Mt. Hamilton continue to collaborate closely on research, building high-tech telescopes and instruments, and designing innovative education programs. Check out the Lick Observatory Archives and our Historical Collections to learn more about the observatory. If you would like to see additional spectacular photos of Lick Observatory, please click here.Lick Observatory has been performing research and public education since 1888 as part of the UC system, but our funding is currently at risk. The Save Lick campaign is raising awareness of the unique research and education programs that Lick Observatory performs and its financial future.For more information, please contact Elinor Gates, staff astronomer.Photos: Courtesy of Laurie Hatch                                                                        HomePhoto GalleriesEvents/RegistrationHotelsParking and ShuttlesShare Your PhotosSocial StreamEvents ScheduleView on mobile/tablet devices or download PDF version &amp;#187; View Mobile VersionYou can bookmark or add to home screen on your mobile device. &amp;#187; Download PDF VersionAlumni Weekend 2014Brought to you by:                 Special Events OfficeEmail: specialevents@ucsc.edu Phone: (831) 459-5003                    ",

The library&amp;#8217;s Regional Oral History Project has gathered several hundred oral histories, which capture the stories of the campus and the surrounding community. Many more are planned for the future. Please join us for an exploration of campus history and an opportunity to meet some of your favorite faculty and staff members who have been our narrators.Founded by Chancellor Dean McHenry who, even before the campus opened its doors, understood how important it was to record the evolving story of this innovative campus and the unique area in which it is situated, the oral history program connects the campus with the community. We have published books such as Cultivating a Movement, which demonstrated the campus&amp;#8217;s national impact in shaping sustainable agriculture, and Out in the Redwoods, which&amp;#160;documented 40 years of UCSC&amp;#8217;s GLBT history. We have interviewed dedicated, inspiring, and innovative faculty and staff, who have founded and nourished interdisciplinary majors such as&amp;#160;history of consciousness, environmental studies, feminist studies, ocean sciences, Latin American and Latino studies, and community studies.This event will include a panel discussion with oral history narrators Professor Michael Cowan, Professor Pedro Castillo, Professor Donna Haraway, retired Library Staff Member David Kirk, and Director of&amp;#160;Regional Oral History Irene Reti. Nikki Silva, a UCSC alum and host of NPR&#39;s The Kitchen Sisters, will moderate the discussion. Also on exhibit at Special Collections is&amp;#160;A Long Listen: Fifty Years of Oral History from the UCSC Library&#39;s Regional Oral History Project.We hope you will join us to sample UC Santa Cruz&amp;#8217;s oral histories and hear about our plans for the future.

A light lunch will be served.The Challenge of ConvictionUC Santa Cruz has long characterized itself as &amp;#8220;The Authority on Questioning Authority.&amp;#8221; By assuming this moniker, our institution self-consciously and courageously shoulders the responsibility of questioning itself: the authority on questioning authority must question its own values, tenets, and perspective. Questioning oneself, though, is challenging, and recent work in both philosophy and the empirical social sciences raises provocative questions about how, and to what extent, an individual or group can effectively and honestly meet this challenge. Presenting research from a variety of fields, as well as some of his own work, Professor Ellis will discuss some of the complex theoretical and pragmatic issues with which admirably self-conscious, open-minded thinkers must wrestle.Visit Professor Ellis&amp;#8217; Faculty Page to learn more about his work.For more information, please contact Hollie Clausnitzer, Philosophy Department manager.

During his talk, he will discuss the technology behind the findings, explain the scientific results, how we are related to the Neanderthals, and what we can learn about human history from DNA sequences.&amp;#8220;The results kind of blur between the lines between species and make us even question the value of (species) as a concept, and I will get into that,&amp;#8221; he said.While Green will discuss advanced technology, he said the talk will be accessible to a general audience.&quot;The cool thing about working in human evolution, and giving talks about this, is people come ready to be interested in it. Everybody wants to know where we came from, who we are, and how we relate to the rest of the world. It is human nature, as they say.&amp;#8221;Click here&amp;#160;to learn about Ed Green&#39;s work in the article, &quot;Bioinformatics expert Ed Green awarded Searle Scholars grant.&quot;&amp;#160;Click here to read &quot;Neanderthal genome yields insights into human evolution and evidence of interbreeding.&quot;Teach-In: Bruce ThompsonSpies: Espionage and Intelligence in the First and Second World Wars2:15 &amp;#8211; 3:30 p.m.,&amp;#160;Porter College ClassroomBruce Thompson, a continuing lecturer in history and associate director of the Helen Diller Family Endowment Jewish Studies Program, will present a talk filled with cloak-and-dagger intrigue, &amp;#8220;Spies: Espionage and Intelligence in the First and Second World Wars.&quot;Every country involved in a war aims to deceive its opponents about the strength of its forces or the direction of its plan of attack. But few belligerents have been as successful as the Germans in deceiving Stalin before Operation Barbarossa, Hitler&#39;s invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, and the British and the Americans in deceiving the Germans with Operation Fortitude on the eve of the Allies&#39; invasion of Normandy in June 1944 . How do we account for these examples of &quot;strategic surprise&quot;? This lecture will explore the stranger-than-fiction stories of the most important double agents of the Second World War: Richard Sorge, who tried (unsuccessfully) to warn Stalin of the imminent Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, and Juan Pujol Garcia (aka Agent Garbo for the British, and Agent Arabel for the Germans), the key figure in the elaborate deception campaign that enabled the Allies to surprise the Germans in Normandy. More generally, at a moment when the activities of intelligence agencies are once again under scrutiny, it will reflect on the history and significance of espionage and intelligence operations over the course of the past century.For more information, please contact the&amp;#160;UC Santa Cruz Special Events Office.

JohnsonThe Reverend Deborah L. Johnson, founding minister and president of Inner Light Ministries, has been chosen as the recipient of the third annual Tony Hill Memorial Award.The award is given in recognition of a resident of Santa Cruz County who exemplifies the work and efforts of the late Tony Hill. It is meant to honor individuals for their efforts in seeking solutions to the needs of our local community, building bridges across diverse communities, and developing innovative approaches to solving social problems.The award will be presented at the 27th annual UC Santa Cruz annual Martin Luther King Jr. Convocation on January 31, 2011. The keynote speaker this year is civil rights activist Terrence Roberts, a member of the &quot;Little Rock Nine&quot;&amp;#8212; the group of African-American students in Little Rock, Arkansas, who made history in 1957 as the first to attend classes under the federal mandate to desegregate public schools.Being selected for the award was a surprise and a great honor, said Johnson.&quot;We live in a community with many progressive people who are doing all kinds of extraordinary work, and to be noticed in such a wide pool of possibilities was really humbling,&quot; Johnson said.She recalled the words of Martin Luther King Jr. when he accepted the Nobel Peace prize.&quot;He described himself as a trustee, and said he was accepting the award on behalf of a movement&amp;#8212;and that&#39;s how I feel,&quot; Johnson said.In addition to being the founding minister and president of Inner Light Ministries, an Omnifaith outreach ministry, Johnson is also the founder and president of The Motivational Institute, an organizational development consulting firm specializing in cultural diversity serving the public, private, and nonprofit sectors.A lifelong social justice activist, &quot;Rev. Deborah,&quot; as she&#39;s known, is the successful co-litigant in two landmark cases in California&amp;#8212;one set precedent for the inclusion of sexual orientation in the state&amp;#8217;s Civil Rights Bill, the other defeated the challenge to legalizing domestic partnerships.&amp;#160;Award nominators praised Johnson&#39;s dedication to addressing pressing community needs and advocating for the disenfranchised. They emphasized her work in civil rights and marriage equality, as an advocate for those affected by AIDS, as a leader in addressing racism and oppression, and as a strong proponent of bringing differing sides to the table for respectful discussion of issues.For example, Johnson opened the Inner Light Center to local faith leaders who had been vocal proponents to Prop. 8, the ballot proposition and constitutional amendment passed in the November 2008 state elections that restricted the definition of marriage to opposite-sex couples. (The proposition was overturned by a United States district court judge in 2010.)The intent of the event was to provide a forum for reconciliation, to live together in harmony, said Johnson.Saying that both she and Hill were people who were unafraid to &quot;kick the elephant in the room,&quot; Johnson added that the mere existence of the Tony Hill Award heightens awareness of the need for inclusion and dialogue in the community.&quot;You can&#39;t really talk about anything that&#39;s invisible,&quot; she said. &quot;So the visibility that it gives heightens the awareness, and it reminds us that good things really are happening. We live in a society that has a lot of sensationalism in the news, and a lot of talk about what&#39;s wrong or what isn&#39;t happening, and I think it&#39;s extremely important for a community to come together and to celebrate its accomplishments.&quot;Past award winners are Luis Alejo, former Watsonville mayor (recently elected to state assembly), and Santa Cruz City Councilman Ryan Coonerty.

We know more about the physical body&amp;#8212;how it begins, how it responds to illness, even how it decomposes&amp;#8212;than ever before. Yet not all bodies are created equal, some bodies clearly count more than others, and some bodies are not recognized at all. By examining the cultural politics at work in disappearances and inclusions of the physical body Prof. Moore shows how the social, medical and economic consequences of visibility can reward or undermine privilege in society.Research Review DayOctober 20, 2011Location&amp;#160;Engineering 2Time 9 amSchedule &amp;amp; more informationResearch Review Day 2011 will highlight some of the groundbreaking research that is being pursued at the Baskin School of Engineering.

A renowned scientist whose work has touched on some of the greatest questions in physics, Professor Rees will use his unique and stimulating perspective to explore the consequences of scientific discovery, the limits of human understanding, and our role as the first species in 45 million centuries to determine the Earth&#39;s fate.12th Annual Sidhartha Maitra Memorial LectureOctober 3, 2012UCSC Music Recital HallTime: 7p.m.Professor Sandra Faber: Modern Genesis and the Limits of Cosmic KnowledgeLess than one hundred years ago, astronomers did not know about galaxies, or that the Milky Way is a galactic mote in a vast cosmic sea of galaxies. Since then, astronomers have made remarkable progress in understanding how galaxies form in our expanding Universe, the crucial role they played in building the elements out of which we are made, and how our planets and our Solar System came to be. This lecture will distill a century of cosmic discoveries to synthesize the modern story of Genesis, and speculate beyond that on the boundaries of the knowable in the cosmic past and future.Research Review DayOctober 18, 2012Baskin EngineeringTime: 8:30 a.m. - 5 p.m.Research Review Day 2012 will highlight some of the groundbreaking research that is being pursued at the Baskin School of Engineering.

Commencement ChecklistThe commencement checklist provides a rough outline of the actions a student must take, in advance, in order to attend and participate in the commencement ceremony.Commencement is not the same thing as graduation. Graduation is the official acknowledgment that a student&amp;#8217;s course of study is complete and, with that, a degree conferred. Commencement is the celebration that graduation has, or will soon occur.Graduation ChecklistMore information about graduationCommencement CeremoniesFriday, June 16CeremonyTimeLocationDivision of Graduate Studies4:00 PMEast FieldSaturday, June 17CeremonyTimeLocationPorter College9:00 AMWest FieldMerrill College9:30 AMEast FieldRachel Carson College1:00 PMWest FieldCowell College1:30 PMEast FieldOakes College5:00 PMWest FieldKresge College5:30 PMEast FieldSunday, June 18CeremonyTimeLocationCrown College9:00 AMEast FieldCollege Nine9:30 AMWest FieldStevenson College1:00 PMEast FieldCollege Ten1:30 PMWest FieldOther commencement celebrationsFriday, June 9thTimeEventCeremony Location3:00 to 5:00pmSociologyRachel Carson College: Red RoomWednesday, June 14TimeEventCeremony Location2:00pm - 5:00pmWomen&#39;s CenterGranaryThursday, June 15TimeEventCeremony Location2:00 PMGLBT RainbowMerrill Provost House3:00 PMLiteratureKresge Town Hall4:00 PMLALSMerrill Provost House4:00 PMAmerican Indian End YearBay Tree: Cervantes Valasquez Room4:00 PMMusic DepartmentRecital HallFriday, June 16TimeEventCeremony Location9:00 AMAnthropologyTBD10:00 AMEnvironmental StudiesFarm10:00 AMHistoryStevenson Event Center11:00 AMPsychology (REQUEST)Media Theater11:30 AMLinguisticsStevenson Lounge12:00 PMCommunity StudiesOakes Learning Center1:00 PMPhysicsISB Courtyard1:00 PMFeminist StudiesHumanities 1 Room 2101:30 PMPolitics/Legal StudiesMerrill Provost1:30 PMEconomicsStevenson Event Center1:30 PMInternational GraduatesHumanities Quad2:00 PMAsian American/Pacific IslMusic Recital Hall2:00 PMHistory Art &amp;amp; Visual CulturePorter Koi Pond2:00 PMFilm &amp;amp; Digital MediaCommunications6:00 PMAfrican AmericanRecital Hall7:00 PMTheater ArtsMain stage7:30 PMFilm &amp;amp; Digital ShowingMedia TheaterSaturday, June 17TimeEventCeremony Location3:00 PMEarth &amp;amp; Planetary SciencesE&amp;amp;MS B206Sunday, June 18TimeEventCeremony Location4:30 PMChicano/LatinoEast Field5:30 PMEngineeringWest FieldCheck with your department or organization to find out about additional graduation celebrations.Transportation, Parking, and Accessibility InformationEach graduating student is provided only two parking passes for a total of two cars per graduate to park in the designated lot.Commencement transportation and parking informationResources and AmenitiesCommencement sites have a Programs &amp;amp; Information tent, a Disability Support tent, and a First Aid tent. Drinking water is provided free of charge. UCSC Catering offers light refreshments for purchase (cash preferred). Restrooms are available in close proximity to the commencement seating areas.Clothing Recommendations for Guests / Sun ProtectionWeather on the UC Santa Cruz campus can change dramatically in a very brief span of time. A chilly, foggy morning may quickly change to a hot, sun-filled day. While rain is unlikely in June, there have been commencements that have experienced unexpected rain &amp;#8212; so check on weather predictions and dress accordingly. For these reasons, it is advised that guests dress in layers that can be easily put on or taken off as temperatures change over the course of the day.Most importantly, flat, comfortable shoes, rather than heels, are recommended due to&amp;#160;the soft lawns upon which the commencement ceremonies are held and the terrain of campus. Sunglasses, hats, and sunscreen are recommended.The UC Santa Cruz campus is deeply committed to sustainability. You are invited to bring a refillable water bottle &amp;#8211; one that you will take with you at the end of your time on campus. Complimentary water stations will be available at the commencement sites. The campus prefers that plastic, disposable water bottles not be brought to campus.What NOT to bring to commencementPetsADA Service animals are the only animals visitors may bring to campus. Pets are not allowed on campus grounds nor can they remain in vehicles for the duration of a commencement ceremony. You will be turned away from campus if you arrive with a pet. There are many kennels, animal day care operations and similar in Santa Cruz.DronesDrones are not permitted during commencement ceremonies.No SmokingAll UC campuses are smoke- and tobacco-free. Smoking, the use of smokeless tobacco products, e&amp;#8209;cigarettes and other nicotine products are strictly prohibited. This policy will be strictly enforced.No Confetti, No Noise-makersConfetti, loud noise-makers, and other items that produce litter or disruptive noise are not permitted.Single-Use Water BottlesUCSC strongly supports sustainability efforts. It is greatly appreciated if you bring a reusable water container instead of disposable plastic bottles.UCSC MemorabiliaThe Bay Tree Bookstore will sell souvenirs and flowers at the commencement sites. The Bookstore offers opportunities to purchase class rings, books, and many items to remember this special day.Once a Slug, Always a SlugThe Banana Slug Network does not end after graduation, it is a life long community. Young alumni &amp;amp; recent graduates make up more than half of our entire UC Santa Cruz alumni population (a total of over 100,000 alumni). Stay connected, find out more regarding the perks of being a Banana Slug Alum, and be a volunteer to help shape our growing alumni program.Lodging and RestaurantsThe Santa Cruz area offers a wide range of guest accommodations and restaurants. Given the thousands of commencement visitors please plan ahead and make your reservations early, as accommodations and dining reservations are in short supply during this busy commencement week.

Graduation is the official acknowledgment that a student&amp;#8217;s course of study is complete and, with that, a degree conferred. Commencement is the celebration that graduation has, or will soon occur.Graduation ChecklistMore information about graduationCommencement CeremoniesThursday, June 14CeremonyTimeLocationDivision of Graduate Studies4:00 PMQuarrySaturday, June 16CeremonyTimeLocationPorter College9:00 AMEast FieldOakes College10:30 AMQuarryCowell College12:30 PMEast FieldRachel Carson College2:00 PMQuarryKresge College4:00 PMEast FieldMerrill College5:30 PMQuarrySunday, June 17CeremonyTimeLocationCrown College9:00 AMEast FieldCollege Nine10:30 AMQuarryStevenson College12:30 PMEast FieldCollege Ten2:00 PMQuarryOther commencement celebrationsFriday, June 8TimeEventCeremony Location2:00 PMSociologyRachel Carson College: Red Room3:30 PMGlobal EngagementNamaste LoungeWednesday, June 13TimeEventCeremony Location2:00pmWomen&#39;s CenterGranaryThursday, June 14TimeEventCeremony Location2:00 PMGLBT RainbowMerrill Provost House1:00 PMLiterature and Creative Writing ProgramHumanities 1, 2104:00 PMLatin American and Latino StudiesViva&#39;s Restaurant, Merrill College4:00 PMMusic DepartmentMusic Center Recital Hall 4:00 PMAmerican Indian Year End Ceremony&amp;#160;UCSC Barn7:30 PMFilm &amp;amp; Digital ShowingMedia TheaterFriday, June 15TimeEventCeremony Location9:00 AMAnthropologyUCSC Arboretum10:00 AMEnvironmental StudiesUCSC Life Lab (farm) amphitheatre10:00 AMHistoryStevenson Event Center11:00 AMPsychology DepartmentMedia Theater11:00 AM&amp;#160;Film and Digital MediaCommunications Building Courtyard11:00 AMLinguisticsStevenson Fireside Lounge11:30 AMFeminist Studies&amp;#160;Humanities 1, 21012:00 PMCommunity StudiesOakes Learning Center12:00 PMHistory of Art and Visual CulturePorter Koi Pond1:30 PMPolitics and Legal StudiesMerrill Provost House2:00 PMAsian American and Pacific IslanderMusic Recital Hall3:00 PMPBSci Physics DepartmentEarth and Marine Science, B2065:00 PMEngineeringEast Field6:30 PMBlack GradQuarry7:00 PMTheater Arts DepartmentMainstage TheaterSaturday, June 16TimeEventCeremony Location3:00 PMEarth &amp;amp; Planetary SciencesEarth and Marine Science, B206Sunday, June 17TimeEventCeremony Location4:00 PMChicano/LatinoEast FieldCheck with your department or organization to find out about additional graduation celebrations.Transportation, Parking, and Accessibility InformationEach graduating student is provided only two parking passes for a total of two cars per graduate to park in the designated lot. Commencement transportation and parking information Resources and AmenitiesCommencement sites have a Programs &amp;amp; Information tent, a Disability Support tent, and a First Aid tent. Drinking water is provided free of charge. UCSC Catering offers light refreshments for purchase (cash preferred). Restrooms are available in close proximity to the commencement seating areas.Clothing Recommendations for Guests / Sun ProtectionWeather on the UC Santa Cruz campus can change dramatically in a very brief span of time. A chilly, foggy morning may quickly change to a hot, sun-filled day. While rain is unlikely in June, there have been commencements that have experienced unexpected rain &amp;#8212; so check on weather predictions and dress accordingly. For these reasons, it is advised that guests dress in layers that can be easily put on or taken off as temperatures change over the course of the day.Most importantly, flat, comfortable shoes, rather than heels, are recommended due to&amp;#160;the soft lawns upon which the commencement ceremonies are held and the terrain of campus. Sunglasses, hats, and sunscreen are recommended.The UC Santa Cruz campus is deeply committed to sustainability. You are invited to bring a refillable water bottle &amp;#8211; one that you will take with you at the end of your time on campus. Complimentary water stations will be available at the commencement sites. The campus prefers that plastic, disposable water bottles not be brought to campus.What NOT to bring to commencement Pets ADA Service animals are the only animals visitors may bring to campus. Pets are not allowed on campus grounds nor can they remain in vehicles for the duration of a commencement ceremony. You will be turned away from campus if you arrive with a pet. There are many kennels, animal day care operations and similar in Santa Cruz. Drones Drones are not permitted during commencement ceremonies. No Smoking All UC campuses are smoke- and tobacco-free. Smoking, the use of smokeless tobacco products, e&amp;#8209;cigarettes and other nicotine products are strictly prohibited. This policy will be strictly enforced. No Confetti, No Noise-makers Confetti, loud noise-makers, and other items that produce litter or disruptive noise are not permitted. Single-Use Water Bottles UCSC strongly supports sustainability efforts. It is greatly appreciated if you bring a reusable water container instead of disposable plastic bottles.UCSC MemorabiliaThe  Bay Tree Bookstore  will sell souvenirs and flowers at the commencement sites. The Bookstore offers opportunities to purchase class rings, books, and many items to remember this special day.Once a Slug, Always a SlugThe  Banana Slug Network  does not end after graduation, it is a life long community. Young alumni &amp;amp; recent graduates make up more than half of our entire UC Santa Cruz alumni population (a total of over 100,000 alumni). Stay connected, find out more regarding the perks of being a Banana Slug Alum, and be a volunteer to help shape our growing alumni program.Lodging and RestaurantsThe  Santa Cruz area  offers a wide range of guest accommodations and restaurants. Given the thousands of commencement visitors please plan ahead and make your reservations early, as accommodations and dining reservations are in short supply during this busy commencement week.

The campus is located on what was previously Cowell Ranch, and the ceremony will celebrate the acquisition of this extraordinary site. The foundation will also be recognized for its generous gift of support toward the construction and naming of UCSC&#39;s first college and namesake landmark, Cowell College, and toward the construction of the Cowell Student Health Center.                                    Since 1964, the S.H.

Further observations are needed to confirm the discovery, which remains controversial.                                                                        2011 Founders HomeEvent PhotosEvent VideosHonorees2011 Founders CommitteeInformation PostcardArea Accommodations                Special Events OfficeEmail: specialevents@ucsc.edu Phone: (831) 459-5003                    ",

She studied humanities at Howard and Cornell Universities, followed by an academic career at Texas Southern University, Howard University, Yale, and Princeton. She made her debut as a novelist in 1970, soon gaining the attention of both critics and a wider audience for her epic power, unerring ear for dialogue, and poetically-charged and richly-expressive depictions of Black America. She won the Pulitzer Prize in 1988 for Beloved, the Nobel Prize in 1993, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012.Morrison will also deliver the Baskin Ethics Lecture at 4 p.m. October 25 at the Rio Theatre in Santa Cruz.Fiat Lux AwardFor distinguished volunteer leadership and outstanding generosity to UC Santa Cruz since the founding of the campus.The Long Family and the Joseph and Vera Long FoundationJoseph M. Long, an entrepreneur and co-founder of Longs Drug Stores, created his foundation, The JM Long Foundation, in 1966 as a way of giving back to others after receiving so much in his lifetime. Vera M. Long, a philanthropist and board activist, established The Vera M. Long Foundation in 1988 so that she could fund the growing number of projects that interested her. In 2011, the two foundations merged to form The Joseph &amp;amp; Vera Long Foundation, a private, family foundation that provides financial support to qualified not-for-profit organizations involved with healthcare, education, and conservation in the communities of Northern California and Hawaii.Alumni Achievement AwardFor boldly pursuing opportunities unseen by others in the financial industry and providing generous support to the Global Information Internship Program.Mark HeadleyMark Headley (Stevenson &#39;83, politics and economics) is board chairman of Matthews International Capital Management, a capital investment firm with more than $20 billion invested in Asia.&amp;#160;When Headley became active in Asian investing in 1989, Wall Street had a &quot;hands off&quot; attitude toward the region, but he saw opportunity. Indeed, well-regulated public markets are emerging across Asia, a region where feudal hierarchies and government interference have historically shaped the financial landscape. Among his many accomplishments is a focus on corporate governance and long-term sustainability; additionally, his main fund, the Matthews Pacific Tiger Fund, won awards for stewardship and performance.Headley has been widely quoted in major financial publications, has participated in panel discussions at conferences of major financial institutions, and has been a guest on both CNBC and CNN.&amp;#160;A generous supporter of UC Santa Cruz, Headley and his wife, Christina Pehl, recently established the Dorothy E. Everett Chair.

He received a joint Ph.D. and J.D. from Stanford University and has spent his career in the Psychology Department at UC Santa Cruz. Throughout his prolific career, Professor Haney has examined the immediate psychological trauma and long-term mental health effects of incarceration and isolation on prisoners. He has argued persuasively that the prevailing prison conditions and policies in many parts of the country violate the legal and civil rights of prisoners. Haney also studies the traumatic social histories of those accused or convicted of serious violent crimes as well as how legal procedures affect attitudes and beliefs about crime, punishment, and legal fairness.&amp;#160;Mistress of CeremoniesTeri L. Jackson Judge of the Superior Court of California, County of San FranciscoThe Honorable Teri L.

She has produced many of This American Life&#39;s most entertaining and memorable episodes, including &quot;24 Hours at the Golden Apple,&quot; and &quot;Notes on Camp.&quot; In addition, she has also headed the program&#39;s most ambitious and topical programs, notably episodes covering the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, health care reform, and urban violence in Chicago.In 2013, Snyder began talking with her This American Life colleague Sarah Koenig about trying something new: making a show that doesn&#39;t follow the usual format of a different story every week, but instead covering one story over the course of an entire season. After a year of reporting, with Koenig as host/reporter and Snyder as editor, the first season launched and Serial became a sensation.Serial&#39;s second season broadcast in early 2016 and set new download records. Serial has won several awards for broadcast journalism, including the 2014 Peabody Award, marking the first time the award has been given to a podcast.Fiat Lux AwardFor exceptional commitment, deep understanding, and outstanding generosity to UC Santa Cruz.The Helen and Will Webster FoundationThe philanthropy of the Helen and Will Webster Foundation is making an exceptional impact on the UC Santa Cruz campus. Most recently, the foundation endowed and named Rachel Carson College (formerly College Eight), honoring the late writer and pioneering conservationist for her courage and pivotal role in awakening the public to environmental issues. The foundation has supported multiple other initiatives across campus, including environmental programs, the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, the Libraries, the Natural Reserves, and the Quarry Amphitheater.Alec Webster and his wife, Claudia, help steward the Helen and Will Webster Foundation, which was established by Alec&amp;#8217;s parents in 1997.Alec came to UC Santa Cruz in 1987 as a precision machinist and technician for the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics. &amp;#160;From there, he decided to pursue his interest in the environment, food production, forestry, and social justice issues, and earned a degree in environmental studies from UC Santa Cruz (Rachel Carson College &#39;02). &amp;#160;Separately, Claudia was putting her University of California degree (UC Santa Barbara &#39;75) to work as an art teacher. Together, they actively support environmental and education programs.Alec served on the South Campus Vision Council, which ignited his passion for the campus historic district and led to the Helen and Will Webster Foundation providing a gift for renovation and programming for the historic Cowell Ranch Hay Barn. The rebuilt barn provides a new landmark at the main campus entrance.&amp;#160;Currently, Alec is a UC Santa Cruz Foundation trustee, and will serve as its next chair. Claudia recently became a trustee of the UC Santa Barbara Foundation. &amp;#160;Faculty Research AwardFor influential research and field work in linguistics, leading to increased understanding of languages and communication.Sandra ChungSandra Chung&#39;s research in syntax combines theoretical rigor with an unusually deep empirical analysis. She has spent her academic life trying to reconcile the demands of a mentalist linguistic theory with the apparent diversity exhibited by the world&#39;s languages.Her empirical focus is the Austronesian languages &amp;#8212;some 1,200 related languages spoken on Pacific island archipelagos&amp;#8212;and especially Chamorro, an understudied language of the Mariana Islands. Her research on Chamorro syntax has helped explain similarities and differences in word order and grammatical agreement across languages, and led her into other areas of linguistics, including semantics and psycholinguistics.She is now collaborating with colleague Matthew Wagers and Chamorro educator Manuel F. Borja to investigate sentence processing in Chamorro through behavioral experiments with Chamorro participants in the Mariana Islands. Separately, she is working with the Chamorro community to preserve their language, which is now endangered, for future generations.Master of CeremoniesZach FriendZach Friend (Porter &#39;01, history) is a Santa Cruz County supervisor and a policy, public affairs, and communications expert who has worked for Barack Obama and John Kerry&amp;#8217;s presidential campaigns, the White House Council of Economic Advisers, the U.S. Senate, Congressman Sam Farr, and the Democratic National Committee. He has a masters in public policy from Georgetown University.Before being elected to the Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors in 2012, Friend served as the press information officer and a crime analyst for the Santa Cruz Police Department. He has been published extensively on issues related to public management, law enforcement resource allocations, and health and economic policy.

She was involved with the Kepler Mission since the proposal stage and contributed to many different aspects of the science, from studying the stars themselves to detecting and understanding the planets they harbor. She led Kepler&#39;s first efforts to generate its high reliability catalogs of planet detections. She also led the analysis that yielded the discovery in 2011 of Kepler-10b&amp;#8212;the mission&#39;s first confirmation of a rocky planet outside our solar system.Batalha served 10 years as professor of physics and astronomy in the classrooms of San Jose State University before joining the Astrophysics Branch of the Space Sciences Division of NASA Ames Research Center. In 2011, she was awarded a NASA Public Service Medal for her vision in communicating Kepler science to the public and for outstanding leadership in coordinating the Kepler Science Team. As the science lead for the prime mission, she assumed responsibility for the data and associated measurements that enable the study of planet demographics in the Milky Way. For her work on Kepler, Batalha was awarded the Lecar Prize and the Smithsonian Ingenuity Award for the Physical Sciences. In 2017, Batalha was named to Time magazine&#39;s annual list of the &quot;100 most influential people in the world.&quot;In 2015, she joined the leadership team of a new NASA initiative dedicated to the search for evidence of life beyond the solar system. NASA&#39;s Nexus for Exoplanet System Science (NExSS) brings teams from multiple disciplines together to understand the diversity of worlds. Kepler has demonstrated that Earth-size planets abound in the galaxy. NExSS contributes to NASA&#39;s efforts to understand which are most likely to harbor life. Batalha also serves on the James Webb Space Telescope Users Committee and as a member of the NASA Advisory Council&#39;s Astrophysics Subcommittee. In 2013, she participated on the task force to define NASA&#39;s 30-year Astrophysics Roadmap&amp;#8212;Enduring Quests, Daring Visions: NASA Astrophysics in the Next Three Decades.Most recently, Batalha has turned her efforts toward the James Webb Space Telescope, bringing the transiting exoplanet community together to decide which targets should be among the first observed with this state-of-the-art facility scheduled to launch in 2021. Through the JWST Early Release Science (ERS) Program, the exoplanet community was awarded 78 hours to observe three giant exoplanets within the first five months of the telescope&#39;s operations.

Hamilton (outside San Jose), using both the -meter and 3-meter telescopes. We observe with a polarimeter, which detects the polarization of light and informs us of how the light is scattered. We can determine properties of the objects based on this polarization of light. We study a wide range of targets including remnants of dead stars (including a supernova, a black hole, and a white dwarf), planets in our Solar System and beyond (extrasolar planets), and stars with disks of material around them (a Be star and eclipsing binary star systems). The main project I am working on at this time is attempting to determine the mass of the black hole, Cygnus X-1, from the polarization of the light reflecting off the disk of material around the black hole.For more information or questions contact: Khaatim J.

To generate induced pluripotent stem cells from great apes, we are reprogramming fibroblast cells isolated from animals at the San Diego zoo and obtained from their Frozen Zoo collection by introducing proteins previously shown to reprogram human fibroblast cells. Comparing cortical neuron development between human and ape cells will allow us to identify the molecular basis of conserved and human-specific features of this process.For more information or questions contact: Branwyn Stewart Wagman | Email | 831-459-3077&amp;#10097; Support College EightSynthesis and Comparison of two tripodal ligands bearing nitrogen and fulfur donors and their condition with low valent metalStudent: Jose Martinez | College: Oakes &#39;14Researching controlled carbon monoxide delivery for therapeutic use.Following the discovery that carbon monoxide (CO) actually has many beneficial properties in low doses and is produced naturally in the body, our research group intends to synthesize and analyze two photoactive CO-releasing molecules as potential methods of controlled CO delivery for therapeutic use.For more information or questions contact: Rebecca J.

The project is inspired by a collection of photographs taken in Okinawa in 1952 by an American Army Captain and dentist named Charles Eugene Gail. The photographs show a deeply human side of the postwar Okinawan experience, as well as offering viewers a glimpse into a landscape that has since been radically changed by the expansion of the US military bases on Okinawa. Our project seeks to raise awareness and open a trans-Pacific dialogue about the postwar US military presence on Okinawa by creating an exhibition of the photographs accompanied by the students&#39; research.For more information or questions contact: Khaatim J.

Essentially, I am looking at sentences like the following:&quot;He likes you&quot;In Chamorro, it is claimed that this sentence would have to be translated as:&quot;You are liked by him&quot;This is because of what is known as person-animacy hierarchy effects--because 2nd person &amp;gt; 3rd person, &quot;you&quot; wants to be in subject position.The problem is that these effects are subtle and difficult to elicit in field studies. Thus, I am investigating this with corpus research. My corpus is the text of the Chamorro New Testament because (a) it&#39;s well-organized and easy to find things in and (b) it was translated by a native speaker.I wrote a program to locate certain constructions in the English New Testament, annotated them for features, and looked at the frequency that Chamorro translations would violate the person-animacy hierarchy. Out of 40 tokens, none were translated in a violating way, making it seem that this property is not just claimed, but is indeed a grammatical constraint.Why is this interesting? My advisors are working on an NSF project looking at psycholinguistic issues in Chamorro. Understudied languages like Chamorro can give us insights into the principles of human language because they have properties not represented in the current body of psycholinguistic research.For more information or questions contact: Khaatim J.

My dissertation looks at the ways that these psychologists, as well as nativist organizations, immigrants and their supporters employed psychometric testing to augment their social status and further their political objectives.In broad terms, my dissertation is about strange bedfellows, and about the power of science to legitimate ideology. The first chapter, for instance, looks at Stanford psychologist Lewis Terman&#39;s largest single study of Japanese-American children (1921-1924). When I followed the money, I found that Terman&#39;s chief sponsor was in fact a Japanese immigrant advocacy organization, the Japanese Association of America (JAA). Though Terman was a noted white supremacist, and a board member of the Eugenics Committee of the U.S.A., an organization committed to immigrant exclusion, the Japanese Association of America provided $10,000 to fund Terman&#39;s project in full, and campaigned for the support of the parents whose children were to be tested. Why did the JAA work with Terman? Both parties accepted what I call in the dissertation the race paradigm--the idea that the world&amp;#8217;s population could be defined and hierarchically ordered by race--and adhered to the then widely-held notion that psychological testing promised a true measurement of the intelligence and behavioral characteristics of a racially defined group. Throughout the dissertation, I focus on relationships like the one between Terman and the JAA in order to complicate our understanding of the way eugenics actually functioned in the U.S. before World War II, and to help us remember that eugenic technologies were once so pervasive that they compelled the investment of those they were designed to marginalize.&amp;#10097; Support Graduate DivisionInfant Development LabStudent: Maddy SpencerPerforming studies exploring how infants learn and when they reach different stages of development, as well as the role of technology in the lives of young children.For more information or questions contact: Jennifer Graham | Email | 831-459-3689&amp;#10097; Support Social SciencesCowell Lime Works Archaeological InternshipStudents: Jacquie Prescott-Frazier (Merrill &#39;14), Stephen Hennek (Cowell &amp;#8217;14)Giving students the opportunity to apply skills they have learned in the classroom to a real archaeological dig.

In Polynesia we set sail with navigators whose ancestors settled the Pacific ten centuries before Christ. In the Amazon we meet the descendants of a true Lost Civilization, the Peoples of the Anaconda. In the Andes we discover that the Earth really is alive, while in the far reaches of Australia we experience Dreamtime, the all-embracing philosophy of the first humans to walk out of Africa. We then travel to Nepal, where we encounter a wisdom hero, a Bodhisattva, who emerges from forty-five years of Buddhist retreat and solitude. And finally we settle in Borneo, where the last rainforest nomads struggle to survive.Understanding the lessons of this journey will be our mission for the next century. Of the world&amp;#8217;s 7000 languages, fully half may disappear within our lifetimes. At risk is a vast archive of knowledge and expertise, a catalogue of the imagination that is the human legacy. Rediscovering a new appreciation for the diversity of the human spirit, as expressed by culture, is among the central challenges of our time.Wade Davis is Professor of Anthropology and the LEEF Chair in Cultures and Ecosystems at Risk at the University of British Columbia. Between 1999 and 2013 he served as Explorer-in-Residence at the National Geographic Society and is currently a member of the NGS Council of Explorers. Author of 17 books, including The Serpent and the Rainbow, One River, The Wayfinders and The Sacred Headwaters, he holds degrees in anthropology and biology and received his Ph.D. in ethnobotany, all from Harvard University. His many film credits include Light at the Edge of the World, an eight-hour documentary series written and produced for the National Geographic. Davis is the recipient of ten honorary degrees, as well as the 2009 Gold Medal from the Royal Canadian Geographical Society for his contributions to anthropology and conservation, the 2011 Explorers Medal, the highest award of the Explorers Club, the 2012 David Fairchild Medal for botanical exploration, and the 2013 Ness Medal for geography education from the Royal Geographical Society. His latest book, Into the Silence, received the 2012 Samuel Johnson prize, the top award for literary nonfiction in the English language. In recent years his work has taken him to East Africa, Borneo, Nepal, Peru, Polynesia, Tibet, Mali, Benin, Togo, New Guinea, Australia, Colombia, Vanuatu, Mongolia and the high Arctic of Nunuvut and Greenland.

She is Distinguished Professor Emerita of History of Consciousness and Feminist Studies at UC Santa Cruz, and the author of nine books, including her most recent book of essays called The Meaning of Freedom.In recent years a persistent theme of her work has been the range of social problems associated with incarceration and the generalized criminalization of those communities that are most affected by poverty and racial discrimination.&amp;#160; She draws upon her own experiences in the early seventies as a person who spent eighteen months in jail and on trial, after being placed on the FBI&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Ten Most Wanted List.&amp;#8221;She is a founding member of Critical Resistance, a national organization dedicated to the dismantling of the prison industrial complex.&amp;#160; Internationally, she is affiliated with Sisters Inside, an abolitionist organization based in Queensland, Australia that works in solidarity with women in prison.Having helped to popularize the notion of a &amp;#8220;prison industrial complex,&amp;#8221; she now urges her audiences to think seriously about the future possibility of a world without prisons and to help forge a 21st century abolitionist movement.Also featuring a performance bySinger and songwriter, AlexisRoseTony Hill Memorial AwardMembers of the Santa Cruz and UCSC community are invited to nominate outstanding individuals for the Tony Hill Memorial Award.

Her 1962 book, Silent Spring, dramatically chronicled the damage caused by indiscriminate application of chemicals in an attempt to control pests. The naming and endowment of Rachel Carson College, formerly College Eight, by the Helen and Will Webster Foundation honors Carson&amp;#8217;s courage and pivotal role in awakening the public to environmental issues.&amp;#160;Silent Spring drew its title from a striking decline in the nation&amp;#8217;s bird populations&amp;#8212;&amp;#8220;the early mornings are strangely silent where once they were filled with the beauty of bird song,&amp;#8221; Carson wrote. The book was an immediate bestseller. The chemical industry responded by launching intense attacks on Carson&amp;#8217;s reputation and scholarship. While terminally ill with breast cancer, she calmly defended her work at congressional hearings. The impact of her work continues to reverberate today.&amp;#160;The endowment by the Helen and Will Webster Foundation ensures the college, founded in 1972 with the theme Environment and Society, can provide research and educational opportunities for students in perpetuity. The gift package also establishes a chair in ecology and environmental justice and a chair in science communication.

Herman BlakeDistinguished sociologist and founding provost of Oakes CollegeThroughout his career as professor, scholar,&amp;#8239;community activist,&amp;#8239;and witness to history, J. Herman Blake has been a mentor and champion of academic achievement for&amp;#8239;all&amp;#8239;students&amp;#8239;regardless of race, ethnicity, or social status.&amp;#8239;Recruited to teach sociology at the newly opened UC Santa Cruz campus in 1966, he was both a founding faculty member and its first African American member. He became founding provost of Oakes College, which he led from 1972 to 1984. He has inspired generations of students at multiple institutions to pursue careers guided by values of&amp;#8239;cultural&amp;#8239;sensitivity&amp;#8239;and academic excellence.In addition to his 18 years at UC Santa Cruz, he served in academic roles at Tougaloo College in Mississippi, Swarthmore College, Indiana University&amp;#8211;Purdue&amp;#8239;University Indianapolis (IUPUI), Iowa State University,&amp;#8239;University of South Carolina Beaufort,&amp;#8239;and the Medical University of South Carolina. &amp;#8239;After his service in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, he earned&amp;#8239;a B.A. from New York University and an M.A. and Ph.D. from UC Berkeley, all degrees in sociology.He is the&amp;#8239;co-author of&amp;#8239;Revolutionary Suicide,&amp;#8239;an autobiography of Black Panther Party cofounder Huey P.

We&amp;#8217;ve been too shy too long.&amp;#8221; With that spirit she engaged fellow trustees and donors in guiding the campaign to its successful conclusion--ahead of schedule, exceeding its original goals, and bringing new vibrancy to campus. Taking to heart the need for everyone to do their part, she brought full circle the experiences she had as a history major and member of the UC Santa Cruz founding class. Her generous commitment of time, energy, and ideas to the campaign and her personal philanthropy embody the goodwill and ethos of public service that is a hallmark UC Santa Cruz, its students and alumni. She is a graduate of the Boston University School of Law and retired associate general counsel at Occidental Petroleum. She makes her home in Los Angeles.Faculty Research Award: Carl WalshThe foremost academic research honor bestowed by the Santa Cruz Division of the Academic Senate is awarded annually to a faculty member who has a distinguished record in researchCarl WalshDistinguished professor of economicsCarl Walsh is one of the world&amp;#8217;s premiere researchers in the fields of monetary theory and monetary policy. His now-classic papers on central bank governance, optimal monetary policy, and inflation targeting have helped set the research agenda for monetary economists for over thirty years and have had a strong positive influence on the way the US Federal Reserve Bank and central banks abroad conduct monetary policy. He has also authored influential articles on how transparency in the conduct of monetary policy can improve economic efficiency. More recently, he has integrated labor markets into monetary policy models in an elegant and insightful way. Carl has been recognized internationally for the quality of his research and teaching. His many publications include Monetary Theory and Policy, required reading in most graduate courses worldwide in his field. He has taught numerous workshops in monetary economics for the International Monetary Fund and central banks in Asia, South America, and Europe, directly influencing the careers of over a thousand young economic researchers. Walsh studied mathematics and economics at Berkeley as an undergraduate, where he also earned his Ph.D. in economics. Prior to joining the faculty at UC Santa Cruz in 1987, Carl held appointments at the University of Auckland (NZ) and Princeton University and was senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. In 2010, he was named a UCSC distinguished professor. He makes his home in Santa Cruz with his wife Judy (&amp;#8216;71, Crown).Thank you to our sponsorsPlatinum SponsorGold SponsorMedia SponsorSponsorship&amp;#160;opportunitiesFor more information about in-kind opportunities or to become a sponsor,contact Alexandra Sibille at asibille@ucsc.edu or (831) 502-8578.

This is especially true in the wake of the 2016 election, as discrimination, racialized hate speech and gendered violence have been normalized and, seemingly encouraged, by the White House. As we enter the 2nd year under the current administration, we must reflect back not only on the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., but of the Black women who, although often misremembered or outright forgotten, fought for civil rights and equality throughout history. In this lecture, Professor Kimberl&amp;#233; Crenshaw will utilize a historical analysis with an intersectional lens to expose the impact of institutional oppression within marginalized communities&amp;#8217; configured networks between identities, i.e. race, gender, and socioeconomic status, a reflect on the contemporary legacy of social justice and the continued struggle for equality in the United States.Kimberl&amp;#233; Crenshaw, professor of law at UCLA and Columbia Law School, is a leading authority on civil rights, black feminist legal theory, and race, racism, and the law. She is the founding coordinator of the Critical Race Theory Workshop and coeditor of the volume Critical Race Theory: Key Documents That Shaped the Movement. Crenshaw&amp;#8217;s groundbreaking work on &amp;#8220;intersectionality&amp;#8221; has traveled globally and was influential in the drafting of the equality clause in the South African Constitution.Crenshaw is the cofounder and executive director of the African American Policy Forum, a gender and racial justice legal think tank, and the founder and executive director of the Center for Intersectionality and Social Policy Studies at Columbia Law School. She is a leading voice in calling for a gender-inclusive approach to racial justice interventions, having spearheaded the Why We Can&amp;#8217;t Wait Campaign and coauthored Black Girls Matter: Pushed Out, Overpoliced and Underprotected, and Say Her Name: Resisting Police Brutality Against Black Women.Tony Hill Memorial AwardMembers of the Santa Cruz and UCSC community are invited to nominate outstanding individuals for the&amp;#160;Tony Hill Memorial Award.

RutterLava Worlds to Living Worlds: How a NASA Mission Sparked the Search for Life Beyond EarthWed,&amp;#160;June 5, 7:30 - 9:00 PMRio Theatre, 1205 Soquel Ave, Santa CruzThe event is free and open to the public.After almost 10 years in space, NASA&#39;s Kepler Mission was recently retired, but not without making an indelible imprint on humankind&#39;s understanding of the universe. Perhaps its greatest legacy is the knowledge that planets outnumber stars in the galaxy. With over 2,500 planet discoveries and another 2,000 awaiting confirmation, Kepler revealed a staggering diversity of worlds, turning sci-fi fantasy into scientific reality.&amp;#160; The Mission changed our collective perspective regarding the feasibility of finding evidence of life beyond Earth and catalyzed efforts across the globe to reach that goal, including right here at UC Santa Cruz.&amp;#160; In this illustrated, nontechnical presentation, astrophysicist and planet hunter, Dr. Natalie Batalha, will share highlights from the mission and describe the exciting initiatives already underway to usher in the next decades of exoplanet exploration.Speaker:Natalie BatalhaNatalie Batalha Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics, UC Santa Cruz&amp;#160;Award-winning astrophysicist Natalie Batalha served as the scientific lead for NASA&#39;s highly successful Kepler mission, which discovered more than 2,500 planets around other stars. When the Kepler space telescope retired in October 2018, Natalie left NASA to join the faculty at UC Santa Cruz, returning to where she had received her Ph.D. in astrophysics in 1997. On the Kepler mission, she identified planets that might be able to sustain life and led the analysis that yielded the discovery in 2011 of the first confirmed rocky planet outside our solar system. In 2017, Time magazine named her among the 100 most influential people in the world.

Throughout the evening, artists and scientists will celebrate the marvel and mystery of life at UCSC’s majestic outdoor amphitheater in the redwoods with poems, music, and storytelling. Not just another poetry jam, The Universe in Verse is the largest event of its kind in the world, bringing the wonder that inspires both science and art to sold-out audiences year after year.For its fourth incarnation, Maria has joined forces with astrophysicist and two-time Universe in Verse alumna Natalie Batalha. Professor Batalha led the search for potentially habitable planets orbiting other stars with NASA’s Kepler mission and its triumphant discovery of 4,000 new worlds, dozens of which are possible cradles for life beyond Earth. She has since founded the Astrobiology Institute at UC Santa Cruz, to explore what it means for humans to be good planetary stewards as our understanding of life evolves and our search for it beyond our home planet continues.Poems spanning centuries of human thought and feeling will be shared by a cast of extraordinary humans: playwright and activist Eve Ensler, Nobel-winning physicist Kip Thorne, author Rebecca Solnit, artists Debbie Millman and Dustin Yellin, poets Donika Kelly and Marie Howe, radio icons Krista Tippett and Jad Abumrad, musicians Zoë Keating and Morley, and Cosmos co-creator and re-creator Ann Druyan, the love of Carl Sagan’s life. We will be honoring SETI co-founders and search-for-life pioneers Jill Tarter and Frank Drake, who are both joining us with poems. As usual, there will be music, storytelling, and some thrilling surprises.The Universe in Verse 2020 proceeds will go to La Noche de las Estrellas — a Lick Observatory, Spanish language initiative, promoting STEM education for local Hispanic youth — and the endeavor to build New York City’s first-ever public observatory at Pioneer Works (birthplace of The Universe in Verse) in Brooklyn, NY.Doors open at 6:00 pm. Attendees are encouraged to arrive early to explore interactive exhibits in the Redwood Lobby of the Quarry Amphitheater (6:00-7:15pm). The performance begins at 7:30 p.m. and should finish before 9:30 p.m.  After the event and weather permitting, guests are invited to take in celestial sights through telescopes shared by local astronomical association members.Saturday, April 18, 20207:30–9:30 p.m.Quarry Amphitheater, UC Santa CruzThis event will take place in a beautiful outdoor amphitheater under the stars and encircled by redwoods.

      "title": "Kraw Lecture Series on Science and Technology",
      "content"	 : "The Kraw Lecture Series in Silicon Valley is made possible by a generous gift from UC Santa Cruz alumnus George Kraw (Cowell ‘71, history and Russian literature). The lecture series features acclaimed UC Santa Cruz scientists and technologists who are grappling with some of the biggest questions of our time.These talks are free and open to the publicOur Kraw Lecture Series is so fantastic, we want to bring it right to you via live streaming. If you aren’t able to join us in person the night of the event, you can now stream the lectures and join in the conversation via online comments. Jul 23, 2020Virtual LectureCOVID-19 Diagnostic TestingThe UCSC Molecular Diagnostic Lab, led by Jeremy Sanford, Olena Vaska, and Michael Stone, performs coronavirus tests for the UCSC Student Health Center and other medical providers in the Santa Cruz community. The lab’s rapid turnaround time is essential to patients and the community in order to combat the spread of COVID-19. A significant increase in testing capacity is considered essential to ensure public health and safety now that there is a loosening of the “shelter in place” orders.Register for virtual eventJun 30, 2020Virtual LectureMarm Kilpatrick, COVID-19Marm Kilpatrick will give a broad overview of the vast scientific literatureon COVID-19 including mechanisms of transmission; high and low riskactivities; fatality, including impacts on different ages and peoplewith pre-existing conditions; challenges in understanding current levelsof transmission &amp;amp; what this means for relaxing lockdowns; and how tointerpret models &amp;amp; projections. He will highlight what he thinks are thebiggest remaining questions and why they are difficult to answer. He willalso, outline what almost all epidemiologists have outlined as the beststrategy moving forward that allows us to both prevent widespreadtransmission and disease and also allow significant economic activity,and why we didn’t implement this 3 months ago and what still hinders usnow.Apr 28, 2020Virtual LectureRebecca DuBois, Viruses &amp;amp; VaccinesProfessor Rebecca DuBois studies how viruses cause infections and identifies weaknesses that can be targeted with vaccines and antiviral therapies. All human viruses must be able to attach to their target cell and transfer their genetic material inside the cell. The virus surface proteins that carry out these entry steps are the same proteins that our immune system can recognize and inactivate. DuBois and her team use an integrated toolkit of structural biology, biochemistry, virology, and immunology to investigate this molecular warfare between humans and viruses. This research provides a foundation for the development of next-generation vaccines.Mar 19, 2020PostponedAnne Kapuscinski, Cultivating Leaders and Solutions for Coastal SustainabilityProfessor Kapuscinski will speak about the new Coastal Science and Policy graduate program which has attracted a highly diverse student body. She will also talk about her team’s research on ecological aquaculture, applying circular economy principles to shift the world’s fastest growing food sector to sustainability. This graduate program and her research both pursue scalable solutions to benefit people and coasts from land to sea. Both also emphasize systems thinking, interdisciplinary approaches, and science-practice collaborations.UC Santa Cruz Silicon Valley Campus3175 Bowers Avenue, Santa ClaraFeb 25, 2020Astrobiologist Natalie BatalhaNatalie Batalha made Time magazine’s list of the 100 most influential people on Earth. She has discovered approximately 4,000 new planets—some of which may turn out to be capable of supporting life. She was recently elected to the American Academy of Arts &amp;amp; Sciences.Oct 28, 2019Adam Millard-BallMean Streets—Self-driving Car Gridlock?Self-driving cars are poised to create the largest upheaval in transportation planning since the arrival of the automobile. Join the conversation on October 28.Self-driving cars are coming to your neighborhood, and your commute, but what are the downsides to this intersection of technology and human behavior? Adam Millard-Ball is at the forefront of efforts to identify problems before they hit our streets. His latest research reveals that autonomous vehicles will snarl inner-city traffic by “cruising” to avoid paying hefty fees to park. Previous work suggests that these risk-averse vehicles will create a pedestrian utopia that will slow urban traffic to a crawl.Jun 18, 2019Anthony AguirreWhere Did it All Come From, and Where is it All Going?he physical universe, Aguirre will argue, is made of matter (or energy) and of order (or information). Aguirre will trace the 13.8 billion year history of this matter/energy told by modern cosmology, as it has developed into ever-more sophisticated order and structure: galaxies and their arrangement, stars, planets, life, and very recently and locally, civilization. The survival of civilization—and life itself—through the coming century is not assured, but if it continues, what could its future look like over thousands or millions of years? No one knows, but touring topics from fundamental physics to the nature of intelligence, Aguirre will lay out some of the possibilities.We are delighted to announce the addition of an open house for our SVLink Incubator–Accelerator to our June 18 Kraw Lecture. SVLink serves nearly 20 UC and UC Santa Cruz-affiliated early stage startups at our Silicon Valley campus. There, they receive mentorship and entrepreneurial support in developing proof-of-product, identifying addressable markets, and engaging potential customers and angel investors. SVLink is just that—a link between the innovative UC Santa Cruz research and the market engine of Silicon Valley. Join us from 4:30–7 p.m. to meet our entrepreneurs and learn about their exciting new businesses. Then stick around for the Kraw Lecture.View the LectureApr 16, 2019Daniel Costa &amp;amp; Caroline CaseyFrom the Beach to the Sea: How Technology Enables Us to Understand Marine MammalsDaniel Costa, a pioneer in the development and use of electronic tags, will discuss how advances in technology that allow precise tracking of marine mammals’ movement leads to better understanding of their behavior and their response to climate impacts on habitats. Ph.D. candidate Caroline Casey studies the evolution of communication between male northern elephant seals. Vocalizations, which are used to drive off would-be rivals, have changed over generations from geographic dialects to individualized and more complex calls.Mar 19, 2019Sandra FaberCosmic Knowledge and the Future of the Human RaceModern astronomy is telling us the story of our cosmic origins—how the Galaxy was assembled, how the Sun and Earth were formed, and where the chemical elements came from that comprise our bodies. We can now use this knowledge of our cosmic past to predict our cosmic future, and it looks bright ahead. We humans have been given the most precious gift of all, cosmic time—nearly a billion years of it. The challenge is clear: what will we do with it? National Medal of Science winner Sandra Faber will describe how the profound insights of cosmology are shaping the new Earth Futures Institute at UC Santa Cruz, which is grappling with this cardinal question.View the LectureFeb 20, 2019Angela BrooksNew Approaches to Treating Cancer Through RNA AnalysisAngela Brooks, an expert in the analysis of RNA sequencing data, is studying the role of RNA splicing aberrations in cancer. RNA splicing is an editing process that enables one gene to produce several different protein molecules. Mutations in the genes that regulate splicing are common in cancer cells. To investigate the effects of these mutations, Brooks and her team are developing the experimental and computational tools needed to directly assess the RNA output of cancer cells and understand how changes in RNA processing affect cell function. This research could lead to novel approaches for treating cancer and other diseases in which splicing is abnormal.View the LectureJan 23, 2019David DeamerAssembling Life: How Can Life Begin on Earth and Other Habitable Planets?Our knowledge of how life on Earth began is incomplete. While some pieces of the puzzle are firmly established by the laws of chemistry and physics, there is still conjecture about what the Earth was like four billion years ago, based on reasonable extrapolations from observing today’s Earth. David Deamer’s research tests the hypothesis that hydrothermal fresh water pools associated with volcanic land masses are a plausible site for life to begin. Deamer will discuss how conditions in volcanic regions like Kamchatka, Iceland and Hawaii could yield clues about the origin of life in a fresh water environment—and implications for the search for life on Mars and icy moons like Enceladus and Europa.View the LectureDec 5, 2018Roberto Manduchi and Jared DuvalUniversal Access &amp;amp; Serious Games—Technology, Disability, and Social GoodUniversal access is the goal of assistive technology, which seeks to enable everyone, disabled or not, to communicate and participate in society. By beginning with an understanding of the physiology, psychology, and sociology of disability, UC Santa Cruz researchers are developing technological solutions that are accessible, practical, and human-centered.View the lectureOct 9, 2018Ryan FoleyShining Light on Gravity: Sometimes All that Shimmers IS GoldIn 1916, Albert Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves, a radiant form of energy similar to light, but caused by gravity. On August 17, 2017, a new kind of gravitational wave source was detected—two colliding neutron stars. Professor Ryan Foley will tell the harrowing David vs. Goliath story of how his small team of young, diverse scientists using a tiny telescope beat bigger teams with larger telescopes to make this incredible discovery.View the lectureSept 20, 2018Beth ShapiroBugs, Bones, and Ancient DNAA leader in the field of ancient DNA, Shapiro uses genetic material recovered from the remains of plants and animals that lived long ago to study evolution and explore how species and ecosystems have changed over time. She isolated the oldest DNA yet recovered—from a 700,000-year-old horse bone—as well as the oldest viral DNA and RNA. By “sequencing the dead,” we gain an understanding of how species, populations, and ecosystems changed, leading to better decisions about how to use limited resources to preserve and protect species and ecosystems in the face of current climate change.View the lectureJun 19, 2018Data Security, Data Privacy, and YouHow UC Santa Cruz is Influencing Information Security for Companies and ConsumersOur digital data—how it is kept safe, and who has access to it—is a topic of shared concern these days. From the latest security breach alert, to targeted Facebook ads, to the privacy updates flooding our inboxes, we’re inundated with news about our data security and privacy. Our panelists, including Aleatha Parker-Wood (Ph.D. ‘14) of Symantec, Assistant Professor Abhradeep Guha Thakurta—and recently added, Assistant Professor Benedict Paten, and graduate student James Hughes—will help us break down the issues and discuss what’s on the horizon in a conversation moderated by Alexander Wolf, Dean of the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz.View the lectureApr 3, 2018Daniel Kim, Camilla Forsberg, and Lindsay HinckStem Cells–Friends or Foes? How Stem Cell Research Informs the Origins of CancerResearchers at UC Santa Cruz are harnessing the power of stem cells to understand the molecular underpinnings of diseases such as cancer, ALS, autoimmune diseases, and anemia. While stem cells’ ability to regenerate tissues holds promise for breakthroughs, stem cell therapies also carry a risk of causing cancer. Join us for a discussion of how to balance the promise with the risk and a glimpse of what stem cell research offers the future.View the lectureFeb 27, 2018Terrie WilliamsThe Untamed Brain: Lessons in Human Cognitive Health from an Unexpected Teacher—Wild WhalesDespite remarkable advances in medical technology, we are only beginning to understand how our brain works. By moving from clinical settings and traditional animal models and into the wild, Williams’ lab is exploring how the mammalian brain is able to function flawlessly during variable stress and exercise levels, as well as during exposure to extreme environments. How diving dolphins and narwhals of the high Arctic avoid cerebral injury is changing our view of brain neuro-protection, and offering unique clues about preserving human cognition following stroke and concussive injuries, and indicating a potential neural basis for mass strandings by whales.View the lectureJan 31, 2018Hosted by Dean Alexander Wolf, Baskin School of Engineering and Assistant Vice Chancellor Mohamed Abousalem, Industry Alliances &amp;amp; TechnologyCommercialization: InnovatorsFrom research to patents and products: UC Santa Cruz faculty and students are an innovation powerhouse.

Green, Assistant Professor of Biomolecular Engineering, Co-director of the Paleogenomics labDec 5, 2017UC Santa Cruz Treehouse Cancer InitiativeMaking Precision Medicine Personal for Kids: How Researchers and Doctors are Giving New Hope to Kids with Cancer Using Big Data GenomicsThere are several truisms about childhood cancer: it tends to be aggressive, differs from adult cancers, and when treatments fail, time runs out quickly. Precision medicine powered by big data becomes personal when university researchers and doctors team up. The Treehouse Cancer Initiative at UC Santa Cruz uses comparative cancer genomic analysis to help doctors treat kids with few options. Learn more about how a new project partnering our Treehouse researchers with Stanford doctors is bringing new hope to families.Featuring members of the UC Santa Cruz Treehouse Cancer Initiative:  Olena Morozova, co-founder  David Haussler, co-founder  Isabel Bjork, director  Lauren Sanders, Ph.D. studentView the lectureNov 1, 2017Carrie PartchCircadian Rhythms: When Our Biological Clocks Go Bad…Carrie Partch joined the UC Santa Cruz faculty in 2011. In her lab, Partch recently identified a gene that suppresses circadian rhythms in cancer, allowing tumor cells to escape daily controls on cellular growth. Now her lab is developing new therapeutic strategies that leverage circadian control over physiology to improve human health. She just received the 2018 Margaret Oakley Dayhoff Award from the Biophysical Society for her ground-breaking combination of biophysics and cell biology.View the lectureJun 22, 2017Exploring Biology’s Dark Matter: RNARecognizing Harry Noller, winner of the 2017 Breakthrough PrizeNoller, professor emeritus of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, recently received the 2017 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for his discoveries about ribosomes, the tiny structures of the cell that Noller calls the “mothership of life.” His insights are taking us right to the brink of understanding the very origins of life on the planet.From his unexpected discovery of the role RNA plays in the functioning of the ribosome has grown the world’s premier center for RNA research. The 16 research labs that comprise the UC Santa Cruz Center of Molecular Biology of RNA are forging new discoveries in the treatment of diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and cancer and developing new technological tools to advance the sciences.Noller will be joined on stage by three Center researchers, Jeremy Sanford, Susan Carpenter, and Daniel Kim, who will discuss their work in the frontiers of molecular biology and the implications of RNA research on treating diseases and saving lives.View the lectureMay 16, 2017Mark AkesonSequencing DNA from Remote Villages to the Space Station: The Nanopore RevolutionAkeson is a professor of Biomolecular Engineering at UC Santa Cruz. He earned his B.A. in History from UC San Diego, and his Ph.D. in Soil Microbiology from UC Davis, then came to UCSC following a post-doctoral fellowship at the National Institutes of Health. Akeson is one of the pioneers of nanopore sequencing and leads the UC Santa Cruz nanopore group. The nanopore group has made important advances in nanopore sequencing technology by analyzing DNA molecules directly from the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. Nanopore technology brings modern genomics out of the lab and into the field—think Ebola or Zika outbreaks—with tremendous potential for human health.View the lectureMar 22, 2017Jonathan FortneyHow Common is the Earth?

      "content"	 : "The lessons of COVID for global and community healthThe UC Santa Cruz University Forum presents The lessons of COVID for global and community health with Professor Matt Sparke. Globally and nationally COVID is teaching us a great deal about the huge inequalities in vulnerability, resilience, and blame as well as instructive divergences in health system capacity, governmental response, and socio-economic disruption. While we are all in this together as human beings it has become clear that our unequal conditions of being human have made for vast variations in how the pandemic has been experienced. Professor Sparke discusses these inequalities and how teaching and research related to global and community health can contribute to developing antidotes to these devastating problems and how UCSC is especially well-positioned to contribute in this way.Featuring Matt Sparke, professor of politics and member of the team at UCSC developing the new global and community health program at UC Santa Cruz, and Nancy Chen, professor of anthropology and former director of the UCSC Blum Center on poverty, social enterprise, and participatory governance.",
