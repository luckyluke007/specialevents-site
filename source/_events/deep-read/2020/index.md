The Deep Read book for 2020 is Margaret Atwood’s latest Booker Prize-winning novel, The Testaments, a sequel to her 1985 classic The Handmaid’s Tale. With The Handmaid’s Tale now a critically acclaimed television series set to enter its fourth season, Atwood’s prescient prose depicting a dystopian future is more relevant than ever.

Sign up for email updates that will help deepen your reading experience. The program, which runs parallel with a class and events on campus, will bring insights from Literature, Feminist Studies, Engineering and Anthropology to bear on Atwood’s work. Informed by some of UC Santa Cruz’ brightest minds, The Deep Read will expand our understanding of The Testaments  and model deep reading practices that will stimulate minds and foster intellectual engagement.
