              <h2 class="underline">Distinguished Honoree: Dolores Huerta</h2>
              <p>
              Dolores Huerta is a civil rights and feminist icon and a 2011 Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient by President Obama.</p>
              <p>Dolores Huerta found her calling as an organizer while serving in the leadership of the Stockton Community Service Organization (CSO). A community organizer at heart, she founded the Agricultural Workers Association, set up voter registration drives and pressed local governments for barrio improvements. In 1955, CSO founder Fred
Ross, Sr. introduced her to CSO Executive Director César E. Chávez, a likeminded colleague. The two soon discovered that they shared a common vision of organizing farm workers, an idea that was not in line with the CSO’s mission. As a result, César and Dolores resigned from the CSO and launched the National Farm Workers Association in the spring of 1962. Her organizing skills were essential to the growth of this budding organization. Dolores Huerta continues to work tirelessly developing leaders and advocating for the working poor, women, and children. As founder and president of the Dolores Huerta Foundation, she travels across the country engaging in campaigns and influencing legislation that supports equality and defends civil rights. In 2011, President Obama bestowed Dolores Huerta with her most prestigious award, The Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States.</p>
