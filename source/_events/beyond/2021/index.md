### Suddenly Distant and Still in Flux: The Implications of COVID-19 for K12 Teachers’ Work

**Date:** January 13, 2021<br/>
**Time:** 5:30 pm

The UC Santa Cruz University Forum presents The Implications of COVID-19 for Teachers’ Work and K-12 Schooling with Professor Lora Bartlett and the Suddenly Distant Research Project Team. The COVID 19 pandemic forced the entire teacher workforce into distance teaching essentially overnight. ough a short-term crisis, the longevity of this pandemic is changing the context of teachers’ work in ways that are affecting the very nature of teachers’ work and the structure of K-12 schooling.
In this Forum the Suddenly Distant Research Project Team draws on in-depth interviews with 75 teachers in nine states to explore the ways that state and local responses to the pandemic have reshaped schooling and teachers’ working lives, affected teachers’ work/family lives, and exacerbated as well as abated long standing educational equity issues. Professor Lora Bartlett and research team members discuss the patterns that have emerged, the implications for the teaching profession and K-12 schooling, and insights into teachers’ feelings about how schools can best navigate this crisis.

Featuring Lora Bartlett, associate professor of education at UCSC, with research team members: Alisun Thompson (UCSC PhD alum) and Lina Darwich (assistant professors at Lewis & Clark College), Riley Collins , UCSC PhD student; Dr. Julia Koppich, teacher labor expert and team advisor; and Judith Warren Little, UC Berkeley Professor of the Graduate School, Carol Liu Professor of Education Policy, emerita, Dean of the Graduate School of Education, emerita.

### University Forum: Immigration policies in the United States: Understanding violence nation-wide and in Santa Cruz

**Date:** December 7, 2020<br/>
**Time:** 5:30 pm

Deportation is far more than a policy term; it is a threat and an act with explosive impact on families and communities. Four in five face persecution – including torture, rape, and murder – in their home countries. Nearly 6 million children are in the care of individuals vulnerable to deportation. Family separation has immediate and long-lasting psychosocial and economic consequences for those deportand and for those left behind. Many under threat have been in this country for decades. Yet, in the face of fear and increasingly harsh policies, communities have organized to respond and build resilience. UC Santa Cruz Professor of Psychology, Regina Day Langhout, lead author on a policy brief, "Statement on the Effects of Deportation and Forced Separation on Immigrants, their Families, and Communities,” will discuss the far-reaching impacts of deportation and collective resistance.

### Small businesses hit hardest by the pandemic

Restrictions meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus have an outsized impact on small businesses and entrepreneurs. Stores, factories and many other businesses and services have closed by policy mandate, reduced demand, and health concerns, among other factors. What are the disproportionate effects on female, minority and immigrant business owners? Governmental responses have been disparate. Economics Professor Rob Fairlie, whose work on this topic has been widely [cited in the media](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/18/us/coronavirus-black-owned-small-business.html), and referenced in [pending legislation](https://www.sbc.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?id=999CE328-3738-40FC-A4C0-2F8760F8E59A), will help us better understand where we are, and assess the early-stage impacts of COVID-19 on small business owners.

### The lessons of COVID for global and community health

**Date:** July 20, 2020<br />
**Time:** 5:30 pm

The UC Santa Cruz University Forum presents The lessons of COVID for global and community health with Professor Matt Sparke. Globally and nationally COVID is teaching us a great deal about the huge inequalities in vulnerability, resilience, and blame as well as instructive divergences in health system capacity, governmental response, and socio-economic disruption. While we are all in this together as human beings it has become clear that our unequal conditions of being human have made for vast variations in how the pandemic has been experienced. Professor Sparke discusses these inequalities and how teaching and research related to global and community health can contribute to developing antidotes to these devastating problems and how UCSC is especially well-positioned to contribute in this way.

Featuring Matt Sparke, professor of politics and member of the team at UCSC developing the new global and community health program at UC Santa Cruz, and Nancy Chen, professor of anthropology and former director of the UCSC Blum Center on poverty, social enterprise, and participatory governance.
