<h2>Please note</h2>
<p>For the first time, <strong>UC Santa Cruz will be utilizing <a href="commencement-check-list.html#tickets">ticketing</a> for each of the ceremonies on the schedule.</strong></p>
<p>Each graduate will receive 6 tickets to distribute to their family and friends for attendance, as well as 2 parking passes. Unless a guest has a ticket, they will not be able to join us on campus for commencement. We will offer <a href="live-streaming.html" title="Live streaming video of Commencement ceremonies">live-streaming</a> for each commencement ceremony so individuals who are unable to join us in person can still cheer their grad on from afar.</p>
<p>Students must register by May 10 to be guaranteed tickets and parking permits. For more information on how to register, visit the commencement checklist. The deadline to register to participate as a non-affiliate (in a ceremony other than the college you are affiliated with) is April 26.</p>
<p><strong>Additional information about Tickets:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deadline to claim tickets is June 10 at 5pm</strong>. <em>After this date, students will no longer be able to access the system to claim their tickets</em>.</li>
<li>Tickets cannot be sold or replicated and are valid only for the ceremony listed on the ticket.&#160;Violations of this policy will be referred to the Student Conduct Office.</li>
<li>Children 5 and under will not need a ticket for admission.</li>
<li>Each ticket has a unique QR code which will be scanned at entrance to the venue. If more than one copy of a ticket is printed, only the first ticket scanned will be allowed entry.</li>
<li>Once you leave the venue, re-entry is not permitted.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have questions about commencement, email <a href="mailto:commencement@ucsc.edu">commencement@ucsc.edu</a></p>
<h2><a id="checklist"></a>Undergraduate Commencement Checklist</h2>
<p>The <strong> <a href="https://specialevents.ucsc.edu/commencement/commencement-check-list.html" title="Commencement Checklist">commencement checklist</a> </strong> provides a rough outline of the actions a student must take, in advance, in order to attend and participate in the commencement ceremony.</p>
<p>Commencement is not the same thing as graduation. Graduation is the official acknowledgment that a student&#8217;s course of study is complete and, with that, a degree conferred. Commencement is the celebration that graduation has, or will soon occur.</p>

<h2><a id="clothing"></a>Clothing Recommendations for Guests / Sun Protection</h2>
<p>Weather on the UC Santa Cruz campus can change dramatically in a very brief span of time. A chilly, foggy morning may quickly change to a hot, sun-filled day. While rain is unlikely in June, there have been commencements that have experienced unexpected rain &#8212; so check on weather predictions and dress accordingly. For these reasons, it is advised that guests dress in layers that can be easily put on or taken off as temperatures change over the course of the day.</p>
<p>Most importantly, flat, comfortable shoes, rather than heels, are recommended due to&#160;the soft lawns upon which the commencement ceremonies are held and the terrain of campus. Sunglasses, hats, and sunscreen are recommended.</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz campus is deeply committed to sustainability. You are invited to bring a refillable water bottle &#8211; one that you will take with you at the end of your time on campus. Complimentary water stations will be available at the commencement sites. The campus prefers that plastic, disposable water bottles not be brought to campus.</p>
<h2><a id="not-allowed"></a>What NOT to bring to commencement</h2>
<p><strong> <em>Pets</em> </strong></p>
<p>ADA Service animals are the only animals visitors may bring to campus. Pets are not allowed on campus grounds nor can they remain in vehicles for the duration of a commencement ceremony. You will be turned away from campus if you arrive with a pet. There are many kennels, animal day care operations and similar in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><strong> <em>Drones</em> </strong></p>
<p>Drones are not permitted during commencement ceremonies.</p>
<p><strong> <em>No Smoking</em> </strong></p>
<p>All UC campuses are smoke- and tobacco-free. Smoking, the use of smokeless tobacco products, e&#8209;cigarettes and other nicotine products are strictly prohibited. This policy will be strictly enforced.</p>
<p><strong> <em>No Confetti, No Noise-makers, No balloons</em></strong></p>
<p>Confetti, loud noise-makers, balloons and other items that produce litter or disruptive noise are not permitted.</p>
<p><strong> <em>Single-Use Water Bottles</em> </strong></p>
<p>UCSC strongly supports sustainability efforts. It is greatly appreciated if you bring a reusable water container instead of disposable plastic bottles.</p>
