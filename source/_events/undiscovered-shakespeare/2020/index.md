**Undiscovered Shakespeare: The Wars of the Roses** is a public arts and humanities series that brings professional actors and scholars together with the public for live readings and discussion of the works that made Shakespeare famous in the London theater. A young writer at the start of his career, Shakespeare explored ambitions, rivalries, and passions that swept away the dynasty that had reigned in England for more than four centuries. Over the course of ten sessions, we will immerse ourselves in these rarely performed plays—in <em>Henry VI</em>, <em>Parts 1,2, and 3</em> and <em>Richard III</em>—and reflect on them both as points of departure for Shakespeare’s career and as a mirror for the times in which we live.
