UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive, in partnership with the leadership of UC UK, invites you and a guest to a special evening at the Tate Britain to celebrate the first major UK exhibition by one of today's most compelling artists and filmmakers—UC Santa Cruz Professor Sir Isaac Julien.

Sir Isaac Julien’s exhibition, “[What Freedom is to Me](https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/isaac-julien)” highlights Professor Julien's critical thinking and how—through themes of desire, history, and culture and by drawing from multiple artistic disciplines including film, dance, photography, music, theatre, painting, and sculpture—his work breaks down barriers.

The exhibition will present works from early films to large-scale, multi-screen installations which investigate the movement of peoples across different continents, times, and spaces. This is the first time Isaac Julien’s work, which spans forty years, will be presented in the UK.
 
This invite-only program is unique for UC alumni and their guests. The evening will feature private tours of the exhibition, networking opportunities, and remarks by Professor Julien. Drinks and hors d’oeuvres will be served.

Register today for this very special evening celebrating Professor Julien, his groundbreaking art, and the power of the UC network.
