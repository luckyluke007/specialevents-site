### Speaker: Bryant Terry

![Bryant Terry](images/bryan-terry.jpg){:class="img-right-50"} This annual convocation celebrates the life and dreams of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. with presentations about equality, freedom, justice, and opportunity. This year we welcome chef, food justice activist, publisher, and author, Bryant Terry.

### Food Justice: At the Intersection of Food, Politics, Poverty, Public Health, and the Environment

How can we provide healthy food options for all Americans, regardless of race, geography, or income? What can each of us do to eat healthier? And how will our choices affect everything from the environment to social justice? In this interactive talk, Bryant Terry shows us how the food we eat can reduce the impacts of poverty and structural racism while increasing sustainability for all. Through a multisensory approach that fuses song, cooking, and personal history, Terry explores how to improve access to fresh food in our communities and demonstrates how simple (and delicious) making better food choices can be.

Doors open at 6 p.m., program begins at 6:30 p.m.
