### Speaker: Mariame Kaba in conversation with Gina Dent, Associate Professor, Feminist Studies

Mariame Kaba is an organizer, educator, curator, and prison industrial complex (PIC) abolitionist who is active in movements for racial, gender, and transformative justice. Kaba is the founder and director of [Project NIA](http://project-nia.org/), a grassroots abolitionist organization with a vision to end youth incarceration. Mariame is currently a researcher at [Interrupting Criminalization](https://www.interruptingcriminalization.com/): Research in Action at the [Barnard Center for Research on Women](http://bcrw.barnard.edu/), a project she co-founded with Andrea Ritchie in 2018.  She has co-founded multiple other organizations and projects over the years including [We Charge Genocide](http://wechargegenocide.org/), the [Chicago Freedom School](https://chicagofreedomschool.org/), the Chicago Taskforce on Violence against Girls and Young Women, [Love & Protect](https://loveprotect.org/), the [Just Practice Collaborative](https://just-practice.org/just-practice-collaborative) and [Survived & Punished](https://survivedandpunished.org/). She is a member of the Movement for Black Lives Policy Table. Kaba's leadership, organizing and influence extend widely as she offers a radical analysis that influences how people think and respond to how violence, prisons and policing affect the lives of people of color. Kaba is the author of [Missing Daddy](https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/1345-missing-daddy) (Haymarket 2019). Her forthcoming book, [We Do This Til We Free Us: Abolitionist Organizing and Transforming Justice](https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/1664-we-do-this-til-we-free-us) will be published by Haymarket Press in February 2021.
