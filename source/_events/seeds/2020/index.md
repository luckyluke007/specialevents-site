**Murray Baumgarten** arrived at Stevenson College in 1966 as a professor of literature. He served as the first chair of the Modern Society and Social Thought major, offered through Stevenson College. In 1967, Professor Baumgarten co-founded the world-renowned Dickens Project, and ten years ago, with the help of the Helen Diller Family Foundation, he established the Jewish Studies program, for which he is now the projects coordinator. Murray is also well known as the co-teacher (with Peter Kenez) of the course Holocaust: the Destruction of European Jewry.

**Gary Griggs** arrived in UCSC’s earth sciences department in 1968 as the campus’s first faculty member with expertise in oceanography, teaching a wildly popular undergraduate course on the subject. He served as associate dean of natural sciences from 1991 to 1994. From 1991 to 2017, Griggs directed the Institute of Marine Sciences and Long Marine Laboratory. Griggs is an internationally known consultant, writer, and public speaker on coastal erosion, sea-level rise, adaptation to climate change, and other issues related to coastal geology. See Griggs’s oral history.
