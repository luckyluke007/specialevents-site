A live and participatory event series featuring readings from the new illustrated book Seeds of Something Different: the Oral History of the University of California, Santa Cruz.

Seeds of Something Different: An Oral History of the University of California, Santa Cruz, just published by the UCSC Library’s Regional History Project, features first-person accounts of the campus’s evolution, from the origins of an audacious dream through the sea changes of five decades. More than two hundred narrators and a trove of archival images contribute to this dynamic, nuanced account.

Each session will feature co-editors of the book and special guest respondents, including some of UCSC's most beloved faculty and staff. The series is created especially for UCSC alumni, but all are welcome!

The fifth session will include guest commentatorrs Murray Baumgarten and Gary Griggs.
