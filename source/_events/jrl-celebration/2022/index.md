Join us as we celebrate the renaming of College Ten in honor of John R. Lewis. John R. Lewis College is UC Santa Cruz’s youngest and one of the most diverse colleges. It is home to a series of robust programs designed to realize its founding themes of Social Justice and Community, all aimed at empowering students to create positive change.

We celebrate this momentous occasion with powerful speakers, performances, and a call to action to empower our students to seek justice and create necessary trouble in their educational journey and beyond. 

A college in John Lewis’ name is a profound honor and a great responsibility for UC Santa Cruz. This dedication celebration will solidify our commitment to live up to the legacy of Representative Lewis, to answer his call to create a more just and fair society, and to leave the world a better place than we found it. 

Come be a part of history in the making!

              We also welcome back our very own <a href="https://www.terisasiagatonu.com/">Terisa Siagatonu</a>, an award-winning poet, teaching artist, mental health educator, and community leader born and rooted in the Bay Area.

The most memorable moment in her career was receiving President Obama’s Champion of Change Award in 2012 for her activism as a spoken word poet/organizer in her Pacific Islander community.
