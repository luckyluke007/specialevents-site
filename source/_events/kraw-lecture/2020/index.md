### The Antarctic and Climate Change: Exploration Above and Below the Surface

##### January 27, 2021
**Virtual Lecture**

Please join us for our second Kraw lecture focused on climate change. Dan Costa, distinguished professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and director of the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz, will share how the changing climate is associated with a reduction in true Antarctic species like Adélie and emperor penguins and crabeater seals, while subantarctic species like elephant seals and chinstrap penguins are becoming more common. Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences Slawek Tulaczyk will share with us how the Antarctic glaciological community is evaluating how much and how fast the Antarctic ice sheet will shrink in response to climate change, particularly the Thwaites Glacier. Join us as we learn more about the UCSC glaciology research group, which is leading one of the large research projects aimed at understanding the current behavior and projecting the future evolution of Thwaites Glacier.

### Telomeres: from curiosity driven research to human disease

##### December 8, 2020
**Virtual Lecture**

</div>

At this special Kraw Lecture Chancellor Cynthia Larive will welcome Carol W. Greider, Ph.D., recipient of the 2009 Nobel Laureate in Medicine, to our faculty and to UC Santa Cruz.

An eminent biologist and advocate for diversity in science, Professor Grieder shared the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for her pioneering work on telomeres and the discovery of telomerase.

Telomeres are structures made of repetitive DNA that protect the ends of chromosomes. Every time a cell divides, telomeres shorten by a small amount. This shortening is counterbalanced by the enzyme telomerase, which elongates telomeres by adding repetitive DNA to maintain an equilibrium in length. Increased telomere length enables the continuous proliferation of cancer cells, while telomere shortening is associated with aging and age-related diseases. Inherited telomere syndromes involving abnormally short telomeres can lead to bone marrow failure, lung disease, liver disease, and other conditions. Join us for this important talk with Professor Greider as she helps us understand telomere maintenance mechanisms at a fundamental level, and how it may allow new approaches to these diseases.

Our COVD-19 response series continues, this time with a look at hardware solutions. Healthcare professionals need to be able to get diagnoses quickly, rather than sending samples offsite to be processed and waiting for the results. Professor Holger Schmidt’s lab is developing technology that could give doctors compact instruments that can deliver test results quickly and onsite. This optofluidic technology, invented in his lab, uses small silicon chips to guide light to either optically excite individual molecules or collect them for electrical detection with a nanopore. This allows physicians to assess if an infection is present, and how strong it is. These “labs-on-a-chip” detect viral RNA, antigens or antibodies, and count the molecules one by one, creating great promise for rapid, low-cost, and accurate testing for coronaviruses and other diseases. This is another example of the advances and promise of the research on integrated devices and nanopores taking place at UC Santa Cruz.

**Virtual Lecture**

### [Marm Kilpatrick, <em>COVID-19</em>](https://UCOP.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_JJ5QBJbLTQCdGyFJsPpfIA)

Marm Kilpatrick will give a broad overview of the vast scientific literature
on COVID-19 including mechanisms of transmission; high and low risk
activities; fatality, including impacts on different ages and people
with pre-existing conditions; challenges in understanding current levels
of transmission & what this means for relaxing lockdowns; and how to
interpret models & projections. He will highlight what he thinks are the
biggest remaining questions and why they are difficult to answer. He will
also, outline what almost all epidemiologists have outlined as the best
strategy moving forward that allows us to both prevent widespread
transmission and disease and also allow significant economic activity,
and why we didn't implement this 3 months ago and what still hinders us
now.

### [Rebecca DuBois, <em>Viruses & Vaccines</em>](https://UCOP.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_JJ5QBJbLTQCdGyFJsPpfIA)

Professor Rebecca DuBois studies how viruses cause infections and identifies weaknesses that can be targeted with vaccines and antiviral therapies. All human viruses must be able to attach to their target cell and transfer their genetic material inside the cell. The virus surface proteins that carry out these entry steps are the same proteins that our immune system can recognize and inactivate. DuBois and her team use an integrated toolkit of structural biology, biochemistry, virology, and immunology to investigate this molecular warfare between humans and viruses. This research provides a foundation for the development of next-generation vaccines.

#### Mean Streets—Self-driving Car Gridlock?

Self-driving cars are poised to create the largest upheaval in transportation planning since the arrival of the automobile. Join the conversation on October 28.
 
Self-driving cars are coming to your neighborhood, and your commute, but what are the downsides to this intersection of technology and human behavior? Adam Millard-Ball is at the forefront of efforts to identify problems before they hit our streets. His latest research reveals that autonomous vehicles will snarl inner-city traffic by "cruising" to avoid paying hefty fees to park. Previous work suggests that these risk-averse vehicles will create a pedestrian utopia that will slow urban traffic to a crawl.

##### Jun 18, 2019

### Anthony Aguirre
#### Where Did it All Come From, and Where is it All Going?

he physical universe, Aguirre will argue, is made of matter (or energy) and of order (or information). Aguirre will trace the 13.8 billion year history of this matter/energy told by modern cosmology, as it has developed into ever-more sophisticated order and structure: galaxies and their arrangement, stars, planets, life, and very recently and locally, civilization. The survival of civilization—and life itself—through the coming century is not assured, but if it continues, what could its future look like over thousands or millions of years? No one knows, but touring topics from fundamental physics to the nature of intelligence, Aguirre will lay out some of the possibilities.

### Sandra Faber
#### Cosmic Knowledge and the Future of the Human Race

Modern astronomy is telling us the story of our cosmic origins—how the Galaxy was assembled, how the Sun and Earth were formed, and where the chemical elements came from that comprise our bodies. We can now use this knowledge of our cosmic past to predict our cosmic future, and it looks bright ahead. We humans have been given the most precious gift of all, cosmic time—nearly a billion years of it. The challenge is clear: what will we do with it? National Medal of Science winner Sandra Faber will describe how the profound insights of cosmology are shaping the new Earth Futures Institute at UC Santa Cruz, which is grappling with this cardinal question.

##### Feb 20, 2019
### Angela Brooks
#### New Approaches to Treating Cancer Through RNA Analysis

Angela Brooks, an expert in the analysis of RNA sequencing data, is studying the role of RNA splicing aberrations in cancer. RNA splicing is an editing process that enables one gene to produce several different protein molecules. Mutations in the genes that regulate splicing are common in cancer cells. To investigate the effects of these mutations, Brooks and her team are developing the experimental and computational tools needed to directly assess the RNA output of cancer cells and understand how changes in RNA processing affect cell function. This research could lead to novel approaches for treating cancer and other diseases in which splicing is abnormal.

### David Deamer
#### Assembling Life: How Can Life Begin on Earth and Other Habitable Planets?

Our knowledge of how life on Earth began is incomplete. While some pieces of the puzzle are firmly established by the laws of chemistry and physics, there is still conjecture about what the Earth was like four billion years ago, based on reasonable extrapolations from observing today's Earth. David Deamer's research tests the hypothesis that hydrothermal fresh water pools associated with volcanic land masses are a plausible site for life to begin. Deamer will discuss how conditions in volcanic regions like Kamchatka, Iceland and Hawaii could yield clues about the origin of life in a fresh water environment—and implications for the search for life on Mars and icy moons like Enceladus and Europa.

##### Sept 20, 2018
### Beth Shapiro
#### Bugs, Bones, and Ancient DNA

A leader in the field of ancient DNA, Shapiro uses genetic material recovered from the remains of plants and animals that lived long ago to study evolution and explore how species and ecosystems have changed over time. She isolated the oldest DNA yet recovered—from a 700,000-year-old horse bone—as well as the oldest viral DNA and RNA. By "sequencing the dead," we gain an understanding of how species, populations, and ecosystems changed, leading to better decisions about how to use limited resources to preserve and protect species and ecosystems in the face of current climate change.

Akeson is one of the pioneers of nanopore sequencing and leads the UC Santa Cruz nanopore group. The nanopore group has made important advances in nanopore sequencing technology by analyzing DNA molecules directly from the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. Nanopore technology brings modern genomics out of the lab and into the field—think Ebola or Zika outbreaks—with tremendous potential for human health.

#### How Common is the Earth? The Discovery and Characterization of Rocky Planets Around Other Stars

Fortney is an astrophysicist who focuses on understanding the structure and composition of planets in our solar system and "exoplanets" around other stars. He has been involved with NASA's Kepler spacecraft since its prime mission. He is also one of 15 principal investigators for a new NASA initiative, the Nexus for Exoplanet System Science (NExSS), which is a quest to find life on planets around other stars. Fortney is one of four new participating scientists NASA has chosen for the last phase of the Cassini Mission to Saturn, as the spacecraft dives between the planet's rings and its atmosphere to collect unprecedented data.
