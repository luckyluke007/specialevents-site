### The 21st Century Revolution in Gender & Sexual Diversity: A New Generation Leads the Way

**Date:** October 12, 2021<br/>
**Time:** 5:30 pm

The 21st century has seen an explosion of new language and new understandings of gender and sexuality, with LGBTQ+ adolescents often depicted as harbingers of social change in gender and sexuality, challenging mainstream beliefs and values and using social media as tools for expression and community building.  In this University Forum, Phillip Hammack, professor of psychology and Director of the Sexual and Gender Diversity Laboratory, will provide a historical framework to understand this current landscape and share research on identity labeling among adolescents in diverse communities in California. Adriana Manago, associate professor of psychology and head of the Culture and Tech Lab, will discuss recent research on how queer youth engage with master and alternative narratives for gender and sexuality via social media and how this process is mediated by affordances of different platforms, informed by offline contexts, and how it looks different at various intersections of gender, sexuality, and race/ethnicity.

### The Filmmaker’s Voice in Changing Media Landscape

**Date:** April 21, 2021<br/>
**Time:** 5:30 pm

Join us for an engaging conversation with award-winning filmmakers and professors in the Social Documentation MFA program Jacqueline Olive and Jennifer Maytorena Taylor, whose most recent feature documentaries are Always in Season and For the Love of Rutland.  

Award-winning filmmakers Jacqueline Olive and Jennifer Maytorena Taylor make documentary feature films and shorts about a range of contemporary social issues, often through the points of view of people in communities that have often been overlooked or misrepresented, but whose lives, stories, and struggles are vital to more deeply and accurately understanding the world.

This conversation will focus on the documentary filmmaking process in today’s shifting media landscape, strategies for working with nuance and in deep relationship with the people and communities featured in their films, and ways in which they bring their practice and values to the classroom and UCSC community.

### V is for Veracity

**Date:** March 9, 2021<br/>
**Time:** 5:30 pm

Metaphors of war and battle in fighting COVID-19, now commonplace, can have their own problematic effects on how we imagine and act in the face of the pandemic. The “us vs. them” imagery that war metaphors promote pulls us away from veracity—“trustworthy truths” that foreground human (and nonhuman) relations and interdependencies. The pandemic provides an opportunity to mobilize veracity for a more just post-COVID-19 future.
