Alumnus Michael Lopp, author of Managing Humans, Being Geek, and the Rands in Repose blog, joins Dean Alexander Wolf to share insights from his latest book: The Art of Leadership: Small Things, Done Well. Lopp's perspective is informed by nearly three-decades working at the intersection of humans and technology in Silicon Valley (Netscape, Apple, Pinterest, Palantir, Slack, and more).

### The Filmmaker’s Voice in Changing Media Landscape

**Date:** April 21, 2021<br/>
**Time:** 5:30 pm

Join us for an engaging conversation with award-winning filmmakers and professors in the Social Documentation MFA program Jacqueline Olive and Jennifer Maytorena Taylor, whose most recent feature documentaries are Always in Season and For the Love of Rutland.  

Award-winning filmmakers Jacqueline Olive and Jennifer Maytorena Taylor make documentary feature films and shorts about a range of contemporary social issues, often through the points of view of people in communities that have often been overlooked or misrepresented, but whose lives, stories, and struggles are vital to more deeply and accurately understanding the world.

This conversation will focus on the documentary filmmaking process in today’s shifting media landscape, strategies for working with nuance and in deep relationship with the people and communities featured in their films, and ways in which they bring their practice and values to the classroom and UCSC community.

### V is for Veracity

**Date:** March 9, 2021<br/>
**Time:** 5:30 pm

Metaphors of war and battle in fighting COVID-19, now commonplace, can have their own problematic effects on how we imagine and act in the face of the pandemic. The “us vs. them” imagery that war metaphors promote pulls us away from veracity—“trustworthy truths” that foreground human (and nonhuman) relations and interdependencies. The pandemic provides an opportunity to mobilize veracity for a more just post-COVID-19 future.
