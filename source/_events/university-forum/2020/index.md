### Small businesses hit hardest by the pandemic

Restrictions meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus have an outsized impact on small businesses and entrepreneurs. Stores, factories and many other businesses and services have closed by policy mandate, reduced demand, and health concerns, among other factors. What are the disproportionate effects on female, minority and immigrant business owners? Governmental responses have been disparate. Economics Professor Rob Fairlie, whose work on this topic has been widely [cited in the media](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/18/us/coronavirus-black-owned-small-business.html), and referenced in [pending legislation](https://www.sbc.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?id=999CE328-3738-40FC-A4C0-2F8760F8E59A), will help us better understand where we are, and assess the early-stage impacts of COVID-19 on small business owners.

### The lessons of COVID for global and community health

**Date:** July 20, 2020<br />
**Time:** 5:30 pm

The UC Santa Cruz University Forum presents The lessons of COVID for global and community health with Professor Matt Sparke. Globally and nationally COVID is teaching us a great deal about the huge inequalities in vulnerability, resilience, and blame as well as instructive divergences in health system capacity, governmental response, and socio-economic disruption. While we are all in this together as human beings it has become clear that our unequal conditions of being human have made for vast variations in how the pandemic has been experienced. Professor Sparke discusses these inequalities and how teaching and research related to global and community health can contribute to developing antidotes to these devastating problems and how UCSC is especially well-positioned to contribute in this way.

Featuring Matt Sparke, professor of politics and member of the team at UCSC developing the new global and community health program at UC Santa Cruz, and Nancy Chen, professor of anthropology and former director of the UCSC Blum Center on poverty, social enterprise, and participatory governance.
