## Fiat Lux Award

The Fiat Lux Award honors alumni and friends of UC Santa Cruz who have demonstrated outstanding achievement and distinguished service in support of the university’s programs and goals. Three Crown College alumni—Lisa Rose, Su Nerton, and Jim Lapsley—have provided distinguished service to UC Santa Cruz, and their support has made an indelible impact on the campus. They were founding members of the Crown Provost Advisory Committee (CPAC), and some of the projects they led include fundraising for the complete renovation of the Crown Library, upgrading the Fireside Lounge, and executing the first-ever Crown 50th reunion in 2022. To top it all off, they joined together to raise over $1 million toward the Crown College Endowment.  All three are outstanding advocates and supporters of UCSC. They have displayed exceptional dedication to UC Santa Cruz and accomplished an outstanding achievement that elevates the campus.

              <h3 class="underline"><strong>Susan (Su) Nerton</strong> (Crown ’71, psychology; computer and information science ’87)</h3>
              <p>Sue’s four years at UCSC created an awareness of how excellent integrated education could be a springboard to whatever came next. She was the first in her extended family to graduate from a college or university. She spent some quality time contemplating next steps, but knew teaching was her calling. Math was always a first love; personal computers were in their infancy and she found them intriguing.</p>
              <p>Susan met the love of her life in 1975 and married in 1977. Tom and Susan lived on the westside of Santa Cruz raising their two boys. She spent most of her early professional life working with school groups to promote gender equity in math, science, engineering and technical fields (now called STEM education.) She worked as a workshop presenter for the EQUALS Project (UC Berkeley), and wrote grants to fund projects such as Expanding Your Horizons Conferences, and Gender Equity in Math & Science Workshops for Santa Cruz County.</p><p>Susan returned to UCSC in 1983 to complete a second B.A. in Information and Computer Science. She taught computer science at Cabrillo Community College in Aptos, California, for 25 years and held the position of Program Chair for both the Computer Science and Computer & Information Systems departments for 15 years. Upon retiring from Cabrillo College in 2013 Susan was awarded the Floyd L Younger Award for Teaching Excellence.</p><p>Alumni Weekend 2022 provided a new springboard for her. With friends Lisa Rose, Jim Lapsley,  a cast of remarkable alumni, and the help of Crown Provost Manel Camps, three years of reunion planning produced the road map for the first Crown College 50th Reunion (1968-1972). The experience of planning and enjoying the Crown 50th Reunion was one of the highlights of her retirement.</p>

              <h3 class="underline"><strong>Lisa Rose</strong> (Crown ’72, Russian literature)</h3>
              <p>While at Crown College, Lisa pursued an interest in black-and-white photography. She was selected to teach a for-credit class in darkroom photography to lower-division students during her senior year. Lisa enjoyed teaching, and two years later returned to UCSC for a secondary teaching credential. After two years of teaching continuation high school on the Central Coast, Lisa moved to New Zealand where she taught math at the Nelson College for Girls for two years before returning to live and work in Santa Cruz in 1978.</p>
              <p>In 1983, Lisa earned an MBA at San Jose State University and began her 25-year career as a business manager for the city of Santa Cruz Finance Department and UCSC Business Services. During these years, she realized the fulfilling opportunities of volunteering. Starting with First Night Santa Cruz, where she was a founding board member, she became a member of the Citizens’ Police Review Board. In 2002, Lisa began her volunteer work for Crown College by creating an acclaimed photographic display of the early years of Crown that included the work of five other student photographers. She didn’t know at the time that this would be a pivotal moment in her life leading directly to her nomination for the Fiat Lux Award.</p><p>Within a year of retirement from UCSC in 2010, she became the lead photographer for Native Animal Rescue of Santa Cruz, a job that transitioned into board president, a position she still holds. Her other rewarding achievement has been volunteering at Crown College, an experience that enriches her life with old friends, new friends, and the satisfaction of doing good for the students of today and tomorrow. Lisa has known her co-awardees Su Nerton and Jim Lapsley since she was 17. Acquaintances at first, they have become dear friends over the four years they spent planning and executing the first-ever Crown 50th reunion in 2022 followed by a successful $1 million fundraising campaign. </p>

              <p>A native Californian, Jim Lapsley is a member of Crown College’s first four-year class (1967–1971).  He met his wife, Carol (Crown ’71), at Crown, and they married above the Quarry Amphitheater in 1971. Carol earned her special education teaching credential at UCSC.</p>
              <p>They moved to Woodland in 1972 when Jim began graduate work in history at UC Davis and Carol was hired as a special education teacher. They have lived happily in Woodland and raised two children, Grace Marie Martinez and Jakob Cole Lapsley, in the historic valley town. Jim first made wine in 1973 in their basement and celebrated 50 years of commercial and home production last year.</p><p>Jim received his Ph.D. in American agricultural history from UC Davis and has held several academic positions at UC Davis, first as a continuing education specialist directing agricultural programs, and later as an adjunct professor with the Department of Viticulture and Enology.  His dissertation Bottled Poetry, a study of the development of the Napa Valley, was published by UC Press, and his book, Successful Wine Marketing, co-edited with Kirby Moulton, won the grand prix from the Organization Internationale de la Vigne et du Vin. Since his retirement in 2009, he has worked part-time as an academic researcher focused on wine and grape economics and history for UC’s Agricultural Issues Center.</p><p>In 2016, Jim reconnected with Crown College when he was interviewed for a video documenting Crown’s first 50 years. He initiated a fundraising drive to refurbish the Crown Library in 2017 and the Fireside Lounge the following year. In 2022, following a reunion of the Pioneer classes that Su Nerton, Lisa Rose, and Jim organized, they collectively conducted the successful campaign to raise $1 million for Crown College from members of the Pioneer classes.</p>

              <h3 class="underline"><strong>Mark Phillips</strong> (Ph.D. ’77, astronomy)</h3>
              <p>Born in San Diego, Mark earned an undergraduate degree in astronomy in 1973 at San Diego State University.  After postdoctoral appointments at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) in Chile and the Anglo-Australian Observatory in Australia, Mark joined the CTIO staff in 1982, where he eventually served as the CTIO assistant director from 1990–98.  He moved to the Carnegie Observatories in 1998, serving as associate director for the Magellan Telescopes from 2006–2017, and director of the Las Campanas Observatory from 2014–2017.</p>
              <p>Mark’s research initially focused on the active galactic nuclei of Seyfert galaxies and quasars (AGNs).  He co-authored an influential paper in 1981 with Jack Baldwin and Roberto Terlevich, on the classification of the emission-line spectra of AGNs via so-called “BPT Diagrams.” In 1986, the appearance of SN 1987A, the first supernova visible to the naked eye since the invention of the telescope, provided Mark and his colleagues on the CTIO staff with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to obtain detailed observations of the death of a massive star.</p>
              <p>In 1993, Mark published a seminal paper that led to a method to measure precise distances to thermonuclear Type Ia supernovae. With Mario Hamuy, José Maza, and Nick Suntzeff, he founded the Calán/Tololo Supernova Survey, which provided the first precise measurement of the expansion of the local universe using Type Ia supernovae. This work led to his participation in the High-Z Supernova Search Team, which, in 1998, discovered that the expansion of the universe is accelerating due to dark energy, and whose leaders, Brian Schmidt and Adam Riess, were awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. For his part, Mark shared with the High-Z team the 2007 Gruber Cosmology Prize and the 2015 Breakthrough Prize for Fundamental Physics.</p>

              <p>As a first-generation college graduate, Abel has consistently demonstrated an unwavering commitment to using his education and life experiences to improve society.</p>
              <p>Abel's path to public service was significantly shaped by a tragic event in 2007, when he lost his best friend to gang violence. Motivated by mentors who recognized his potential, he channeled his personal experiences into advocating for informed and impactful public policy changes. While at Richmond High School, Abel was elected by his peers to serve on the school site council. He played a pivotal role in establishing both the City of San Pablo and the West Contra Costa Unified School District Youth Commission, highlighting his early dedication to community involvement.</p>
              <p>Abel served Assembly District 15 as a principal field representative for former State Assemblyman Tony Thurmond, spanning two terms in the state legislature. His political acumen became evident in 2017 when he ran for California Democratic Party delegate, emerging as the youngest candidate. Subsequently, he continued his public service with State Assemblyman Rob Bonta in 2019, focusing on crucial issues such as public safety, education, health, insurance, social services, and transportation.</p>
              <p>In 2019, Abel made history as City of San Pablo’s youngest elected official at age 26, later becoming vice mayor at age 29, and, at age 30, assuming the role as mayor. He stands among the youngest mayors ever to serve in California and the United States. He is dedicated to championing the cause of the city's most vulnerable populations, driving improved outcomes, enhancing the overall quality of life for all residents, and fostering partnerships that facilitate easier access to essential resources and opportunities.</p>
              <p>In 2020, Abel reached another milestone in his career by being sworn in as the Northern California regional field liaison for State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond. This role enables him to make an impact on education policies and initiatives across the state.</p>
              <p>Abel's transformation from a dedicated student leader to public servant is a powerful testament to his passion for uplifting his community and forging a brighter future for all. He is committed to effecting positive change.</p>
